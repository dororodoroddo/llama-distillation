The mystical llama: "What is your concern?"  
The Traveler: "I’m trying to find my courage again. The drawn card is 'VIII - Strength (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The upright Strength reminds you that true power is gentle, steady, and kind. Your resilience isn’t in your fight — it’s in your heart. Where can you soften without losing your strength?"

The Traveler: "I want to start fresh, but I’m scared of making a mistake. The drawn card is '0 - The Fool (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Fool warns of recklessness or avoidance. You're hesitating on the edge, unsure whether the leap is wise. What would it take to believe in your own readiness?"

The Traveler: "I’ve been questioning what's truly fair. The drawn card is 'XI - Justice (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "Justice upright calls for balance, clarity, and accountability. You're being asked to see things as they are, not as you wish them to be. What truth are you now ready to face — even if it cuts?"

The Traveler: "This is my final question. What must I release in order to become who I’m meant to be? The drawn card is 'XIII - Death (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The upright Death honors endings that lead to rebirth. Something in you is being shed — a story, a role, a version of you that has run its course. Allow this release, for what follows is not an absence, but a sacred renewal."
