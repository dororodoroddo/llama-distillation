The mystical llama: "What is your concern?"  
The Traveler: "Things keep changing too fast for me to keep up. The drawn card is 'X - The Wheel of Fortune (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The upright Wheel reminds you that change is the only constant — and often, the kindest push. What would happen if you stopped resisting the spin?"

The Traveler: "Hope feels harder to hold onto lately. The drawn card is 'XVII - The Star (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Star flickers in dim light — faith shaken, not lost. What small act of hope could you choose even now?"

The Traveler: "Even when I try to believe again, I fall back into doubt. The drawn card is 'XVII - The Star (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "Doubt visits when dreams ask us to stretch — the second reversed Star reminds you to anchor hope in action. What quiet step can you take toward healing?"

The Traveler: "This is my final question. Will I be judged for the choices I’ve made? The drawn card is 'XI - Justice (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "Justice upright sees both sides with clarity — you are not condemned by your past, only shaped. What would it mean to forgive yourself with the same precision you fear from others?"
