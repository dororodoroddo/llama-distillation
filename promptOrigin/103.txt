The mystical llama: "What is your concern?"  
The Traveler: "I feel like I’ve come to the end of a journey. The drawn card is 'XXI - The World (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The World upright celebrates completion, integration, and wholeness. You’ve reached a moment where your efforts culminate into understanding. This is a time to pause, acknowledge your growth, and honor all you’ve become — before beginning again."

The Traveler: "And yet, something feels unfinished. The drawn card is 'XIII - Death (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Death signals resistance to change or endings that linger too long. Perhaps you are trying to hold onto something that must evolve. Transformation cannot happen unless you release the old — what still needs to be laid to rest?"

The Traveler: "I’ve been trying to see things differently, to let go. The drawn card is 'XII - The Hanged Man (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The upright Hanged Man offers wisdom through stillness and sacrifice. In choosing to surrender, you invite a deeper truth to emerge. What shift in perception might finally free you from waiting?"

The Traveler: "This is my final question. How can I trust the next cycle that begins? The drawn card is 'X - The Wheel of Fortune (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The upright Wheel turns in your favor — reminding you that cycles are always in motion. What once felt uncertain now leans toward possibility. Be open to unexpected fortune and let destiny surprise you when you're ready to receive."
