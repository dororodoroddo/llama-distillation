The mystical llama: "What is your concern?"  
The Traveler: "I’ve been stuck in indecision, waiting for a sign. The drawn card is 'XII - The Hanged Man (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Hanged Man reveals avoidance masquerading as patience — insight comes through surrender, not delay. What truth are you not yet ready to face?"

The Traveler: "I know I have potential, but I keep hesitating. The drawn card is 'I - The Magician (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The upright Magician reminds you that your power is already within reach — the hesitation isn’t from lack, but fear. What would happen if you acted as though you were already enough?"

The Traveler: "Still, I fear I’m too chaotic to build anything stable. The drawn card is 'IV - The Emperor (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Emperor struggles with inner authority — not a lack of control, but a lack of trust. What structure could emerge if you stopped questioning your right to lead?"

The Traveler: "This is my final question. Is it time to make a bold move? The drawn card is 'X - The Wheel of Fortune (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The upright Wheel spins in your favor — not as luck, but alignment. What leap feels uncertain, yet true?"
