The mystical llama: "What is your concern?"  
The Traveler: "I’ve lost touch with my intuition. The drawn card is 'II - The High Priestess (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed High Priestess suggests a disconnect from your inner knowing. The answers haven’t left — they’ve only quieted beneath distraction. Where can you make space to hear again?"

The Traveler: "I want to believe in healing. The drawn card is 'XVII - The Star (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The Star upright offers gentle hope, renewal, and cosmic grace. Healing isn’t linear, but it is real. What if you trusted your pain as part of your path — not a detour?"

The Traveler: "Light is returning. The drawn card is 'XIX - The Sun (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The Sun upright brings clarity, joy, and illumination. What was hidden now begins to shine. Can you let yourself bask in this warmth without shrinking from it?"

The Traveler: "This is my final question. What does love ask of me now? The drawn card is 'VI - The Lovers (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The Lovers upright blesses sacred connection and deliberate choice. You are being invited into alignment — not just with another, but with your own truth. This is not just love, but self-recognition."
