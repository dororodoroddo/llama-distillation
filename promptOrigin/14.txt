The mystical llama: "What is your concern?"  
The Traveler: "I’ve lost my sense of hope. Even when I try to believe, it just feels hollow. The drawn card is 'XVII - The Star (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "Reversed Star reflects disillusionment, spiritual fatigue, and the quiet grief of fading dreams — but hope is not loud, and belief is not constant. What would it mean to sit beside the emptiness, without trying to fix it?"

The Traveler: "I think I’ve been numbing myself instead. It’s easier than feeling. The drawn card is 'XV - The Devil (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The upright Devil reveals attachment, escape, and seductive illusion — what comforts you may also be what cages you. What are you avoiding by staying tethered to what hurts you gently?"

The Traveler: "I want to come back to myself, but I don’t know how. The drawn card is 'XIV - Temperance (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "Temperance upright offers healing through presence, not perfection — it asks for small alignments, not grand gestures. What simple act could bring you closer to your center today?"

The Traveler: "This is my final question. Can I really become whole again? The drawn card is 'VIII - Strength (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The upright Strength reminds you that wholeness isn’t found in power, but in gentleness toward your own pain. You are not weak for breaking — you are strong for choosing to mend."
