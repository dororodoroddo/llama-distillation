The mystical llama: "What is your concern?"  
The Traveler: "I feel like something in my life is ending, but I don’t know what’s next. The drawn card is 'XIII - Death (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The upright Death marks profound change — what no longer grows must be laid to rest. What space is being made within you for new life?"

The Traveler: "There’s a connection I can’t stop thinking about. The drawn card is 'VI - The Lovers (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The Lovers upright reflect soulful bonds and conscious choice. What part of yourself do you see most clearly through them?"

The Traveler: "I’ve lost some of the hope I once had. The drawn card is 'XVII - The Star (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Star shows dimmed light — not lost, but hidden. What would it take to believe again, even quietly?"

The Traveler: "This is my final question. Am I becoming who I’m meant to be? The drawn card is 'XX - Judgement (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "Judgement upright calls for rebirth through recognition. What version of you is ready to rise from all that has passed?"
