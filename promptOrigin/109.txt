The mystical llama: "What is your concern?"  
The Traveler: "I feel love blooming, but I’m afraid of choosing wrong. The drawn card is 'VI - The Lovers (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The Lovers upright offers the beauty and responsibility of choice. You are not simply drifting — you are aligning. What would it look like to choose what aligns not just with your heart, but your integrity?"

The Traveler: "I want to be stronger, braver. The drawn card is 'VIII - Strength (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "Strength upright speaks not of force, but of compassion, patience, and inner resilience. You already hold the courage you seek. Where can you soften instead of push, and still feel powerful?"

The Traveler: "I’m afraid of losing control. The drawn card is 'VII - The Chariot (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Chariot signals a struggle between intention and chaos. Your path may feel unstable, but clarity begins when you stop forcing direction. What would it mean to pause and ask where you truly want to go?"

The Traveler: "This is my final question. How do I answer a calling that feels too big for me? The drawn card is 'XX - Judgement (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Judgement asks: are you truly listening to your inner calling, or are you afraid of what it might demand? This is not a moment to shrink — but to rise with full awareness. You are being asked to shed an old version of yourself. Can you allow the transformation?"
