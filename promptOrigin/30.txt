The mystical llama: "What is your concern?"  
The Traveler: "I can’t shake the feeling that I’ve done something unforgivable. The drawn card is 'XI - Justice (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Justice asks whether you seek punishment or resolution — you cannot rewrite the past, but you can stop reliving it. What would it take to hold yourself accountable without living in exile?"

The Traveler: "I used to have hope. Now everything just feels dim and distant. The drawn card is 'XVII - The Star (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "Reversed Star reveals a heart still bruised by disappointment — the light isn’t gone, it’s simply quiet. Are you willing to hope again, even if you’ve stopped believing?"

The Traveler: "Every time I try to move forward, I talk myself out of it. The drawn card is '0 - The Fool (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Fool holds the fear of misstep — you are not afraid of beginning, but of beginning alone. What if uncertainty is not danger, but the path unfolding?"

The Traveler: "This is my final question. Will I ever feel whole again? The drawn card is 'XXI - The World (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed World suggests a cycle unfinished — not because you’ve failed, but because you haven’t fully arrived in the now. Wholeness isn’t ahead. It’s the part of you waiting to be welcomed home."
