The mystical llama: "What is your concern?"  
The Traveler: "I feel like I’ve lost control of my own direction. The drawn card is 'IV - The Emperor (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Emperor suggests crumbling stability or misused authority. You're not lost — just being asked to rebuild on new terms. Where can you lead from alignment rather than fear?"

The Traveler: "I’m stuck in something I know is unhealthy. The drawn card is 'XV - The Devil (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The Devil upright reveals chains you may pretend aren’t there — a bond, habit, or story that feeds on silence. What are you gaining by staying bound, and what might you gain by stepping away?"

The Traveler: "I want things to be fair, but I’m not sure they are. The drawn card is 'XI - Justice (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "Justice upright demands truth, accountability, and balance. What you seek must begin inside — in your choices, in your clarity. What are you willing to see, even if it shifts the whole story?"

The Traveler: "This is my final question. How do I take control without repeating the past? The drawn card is 'I - The Magician (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The Magician upright reminds you that you already hold the tools to shape your path. Intention is your wand. Will you use your power to repeat old patterns — or create something new entirely?"
