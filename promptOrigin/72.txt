The mystical llama: "What is your concern?"  
The Traveler: "I’ve been stuck, like no movement is possible. The drawn card is 'XII - The Hanged Man (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Hanged Man speaks of resistance to surrender — stuckness isn’t always external. What perspective are you refusing to shift?"

The Traveler: "But I still catch glimpses of hope, like the sky might clear. The drawn card is 'XIX - The Sun (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The Sun upright brings light, clarity, and renewal — but only if you let it in. What in your life is trying to grow, if you’d just let it?"

The Traveler: "Even the impossible has started to feel possible. The drawn card is 'XVII - The Star (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The upright Star is healing and hope — subtle but steady. What small light is asking for your faith?"

The Traveler: "This is my final question. Can I really leave the past behind? The drawn card is 'XXI - The World (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed World warns of incomplete endings — the cycle repeats until it’s closed. What thread still tethers you to what has already passed?"
