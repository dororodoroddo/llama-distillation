The mystical llama: "What is your concern?"  
The Traveler: "I feel like I’ve sacrificed too much, and now I don’t even know who I am. The drawn card is 'XII - The Hanged Man (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Hanged Man speaks of martyrdom without meaning — suspended, but unwilling to shift. What are you giving up that no longer serves your growth?"

The Traveler: "My emotions feel unclear and overwhelming. The drawn card is 'XVIII - The Moon (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Moon reveals illusions, denial, and inner confusion. What truth are you avoiding because it feels too painful?"

The Traveler: "And yet, someone came into my life who makes me feel deeply seen. The drawn card is 'VI - The Lovers (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The Lovers upright is a mirror of choice and authentic connection. What values are you willing to stand by — even if it costs comfort?"

The Traveler: "This is my final question. Is it possible to feel whole again? The drawn card is 'III - The Empress (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Empress calls you inward — to restore, replenish, and release old depletion. What kindness can you offer your own heart today?"
