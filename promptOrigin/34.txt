The mystical llama: "What is your concern?"  
The Traveler: "I want to make a decision that feels just — not only for others, but for myself. The drawn card is 'XI - Justice (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "Justice upright is balance through clarity — not perfection, but alignment. What truth do you keep returning to, no matter who it disappoints?"

The Traveler: "But I feel like I’ve lost my authority in my own life. The drawn card is 'IV - The Emperor (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Emperor points to collapsed structure — the walls you built may now feel like they’re keeping you in. What kind of power are you ready to reclaim — not over others, but over your own direction?"

The Traveler: "Still, I want to believe something beautiful is possible. The drawn card is 'XVII - The Star (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The Star upright is hope in its purest form — gentle, slow, and persistent. Even in the absence of proof, it asks you to hold out your hands. What dream won’t leave you alone?"

The Traveler: "This is my final question. Will I ever feel like I’m whole? The drawn card is 'XXI - The World (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The World upright speaks of arrival — not at the end of striving, but in the return to self. You are not a puzzle waiting to be solved. You are the moment when all of you agrees to stay."
