The mystical llama: "What is your concern?"  
The Traveler: "I feel like I’m pretending things are fine when they’re really not. The drawn card is 'XVI - The Tower (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Tower shows inner collapse held back by denial — destruction deferred, but still brewing. What might fall if you stopped trying to hold it all together?"

The Traveler: "I know something needs to end, but I also feel a strange peace about it. The drawn card is 'XIII - Death (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The upright Death brings closure and calm — not through absence, but transformation. What part of your life is asking to be released with grace?"

The Traveler: "I’m doing my best to find balance again. The drawn card is 'XIV - Temperance (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "Temperance upright is healing through harmony — not perfection, but integration. What opposites in you are ready to make peace?"

The Traveler: "This is my final question. Am I resisting the changes I actually need? The drawn card is 'X - The Wheel of Fortune (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Wheel reflects fear of letting go — the cycle stalls when you grasp too tightly. What would trusting the unknown feel like?"
