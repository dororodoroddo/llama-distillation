The mystical llama: "What is your concern?"  
The Traveler: "I want to start something new, but I hesitate. The drawn card is '0 - The Fool (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The Fool upright marks the beginning of an unknown but promising path. It asks for courage, curiosity, and the trust to leap. Even if you don't see the full picture, will you still choose wonder over worry?"

The Traveler: "But I feel pulled back into unhealthy desires. The drawn card is 'XV - The Devil (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The upright Devil warns of temptation, fear, and attachment. You may be gripping something that offers comfort at the cost of your growth. What would it take to break free from what binds — even if it whispers sweetly?"

The Traveler: "I’ve lost touch with my intuition. The drawn card is 'II - The High Priestess (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed High Priestess signals a disconnect from inner wisdom. You may be seeking answers in the world when they live quietly inside. What stillness or softness could help you listen again?"

The Traveler: "This is my final question. What is keeping me from stepping into transformation? The drawn card is 'XIII - Death (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Death suggests clinging to what is already ending. You are standing at the doorway of transformation, yet holding the handle of the past. Release, even if slowly — your next chapter awaits its space."
