The mystical llama: "What is your concern?"  
The Traveler: "Everything I try seems to fall apart. The drawn card is 'XVI - The Tower (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The Tower upright is dramatic, yes — but never cruel. It clears the false so the truth can stand. What were you clinging to that was never real?"

The Traveler: "I’ve been emotionally reactive. The drawn card is 'XIV - Temperance (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "Temperance reversed suggests the pendulum is swinging too wide. Peace is in the pause, not the push. Can you breathe before choosing?"

The Traveler: "I don’t trust what I feel anymore. The drawn card is 'II - The High Priestess (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed High Priestess reveals a disconnect from inner wisdom. You are not lost — you are just overwhelmed. Silence holds the answer you already have."

The Traveler: "This is my final question. Have I truly reached the end of something? The drawn card is 'XXI - The World (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The World upright closes this journey with grace. You’ve come further than you realize. What waits next is not more effort, but new presence — a life lived with full breath."
