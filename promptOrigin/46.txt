The mystical llama: "What is your concern?"  
The Traveler: "I’ve started to feel hope again… but I’m scared it’s too fragile. The drawn card is 'XVII - The Star (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The Star upright offers quiet renewal — not blinding light, but a soft glimmer guiding you home. Can you trust hope even when it’s still faint?"

The Traveler: "I still carry the wounds from a broken connection. The drawn card is 'VI - The Lovers (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Lovers speak of disconnection and disharmony. This pain doesn’t mean you failed — only that something wasn’t aligned. What have you learned about your own needs in love?"

The Traveler: "I want to move forward, but I need to feel like I’m in control again. The drawn card is 'VII - The Chariot (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The Chariot upright grants you the reins — not to escape the past, but to steer through it with will. What direction feels like yours, not someone else’s?"

The Traveler: "This is my final question. Why do I still feel lost, even after all this progress? The drawn card is 'XVIII - The Moon (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Moon unveils confusion — illusions that begin to lift, even as they leave shadows. What fear remains once the fog clears?"
