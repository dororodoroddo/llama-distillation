The mystical llama: "What is your concern?"  
The Traveler: "I think I’ve reached the end of something, but I don’t know what’s next. The drawn card is 'XXI - The World (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The World upright completes cycles with grace — but closure often brings silence before sound. What ending are you ready to honor, so that a new beginning may speak?"

The Traveler: "Still, I feel like I’m misreading something… like the truth is half-hidden. The drawn card is 'XVIII - The Moon (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Moon lets shadows fade — but clarity can be just as frightening. What do you see now that you’re no longer in the dark?"

The Traveler: "I want to feel strong in my decisions again. The drawn card is 'IV - The Emperor (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The Emperor upright brings structure, not control — power, not pressure. What would it look like to lead your own life with authority and compassion?"

The Traveler: "This is my final question. Will joy return — or is this all there is? The drawn card is 'XIX - The Sun (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The upright Sun brings light, warmth, and clarity — joy not as a reward, but as a return to truth. What joy is already waiting for you, if you simply turned toward it?"
