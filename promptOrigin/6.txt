The mystical llama: "What is your concern?"  
The Traveler: "I feel lost in my sense of purpose lately. The drawn card is 'IX - The Hermit (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The upright Hermit calls for retreat, reflection, and quiet seeking — your purpose isn’t gone, it’s just whispering beneath the noise. Are you searching for meaning outside, when it’s trying to rise from within?"

The Traveler: "I’ve been trying to look inward, but it just feels empty. The drawn card is 'V - The Hierophant (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Hierophant suggests a departure from established beliefs or institutions — perhaps the emptiness you feel isn’t absence, but space clearing out what no longer fits. What truth would you trust if it didn’t have to follow any rules?"

The Traveler: "That makes me wonder if I’ve been lying to myself. The drawn card is 'VII - The Chariot (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Chariot warns of directionless drive or inner conflict — maybe your willpower has been pushing forward without asking where your heart wants to go. What would happen if you let go of the need to ‘progress’ and just listened?"

The Traveler: "This is my final question. If I stop striving and searching, will I still become who I’m meant to be? The drawn card is 'XXI - The World (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The upright World speaks of wholeness, completion, and alignment — your becoming is not at the end of effort, but in the unfolding of presence. You are not lost; you are already part of the path you seek."
