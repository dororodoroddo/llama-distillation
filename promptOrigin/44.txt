The mystical llama: "What is your concern?"  
The Traveler: "I’ve withdrawn from people lately… I just need space. The drawn card is 'IX - The Hermit (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The Hermit upright reflects introspection and the need to walk alone for a while. What answers might be waiting in the quiet you’ve chosen?"

The Traveler: "But even in that stillness, I can’t seem to trust what I feel. The drawn card is 'II - The High Priestess (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed High Priestess clouds your intuition — too much thinking, not enough listening. What happens when you stop trying to decode everything?"

The Traveler: "I want to do what’s right, but the weight of decisions is heavy. The drawn card is 'XI - Justice (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "Justice upright invites you to align with truth — not perfection, but clarity. What are you afraid will be revealed if you’re fully honest with yourself?"

The Traveler: "This is my final question. Am I ready to let go of what no longer fits? The drawn card is 'XIII - Death (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The upright Death blesses you with release — not loss, but transformation. What old skin are you shedding so your truer self can emerge?"
