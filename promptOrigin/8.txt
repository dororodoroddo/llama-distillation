The mystical llama: "What is your concern?"  
The Traveler: "I want to pursue something creative, but I don’t know if I’m good enough. The drawn card is 'II - The High Priestess (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The upright High Priestess symbolizes intuition, inner wisdom, and hidden potential — your doubt is loud, but your truth is quiet and waiting. Are you listening to the fear, or to the part of you that already knows?"

The Traveler: "Sometimes I can hear it, but it fades quickly. The drawn card is 'VII - The Chariot (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The upright Chariot speaks of focused will and self-mastery — the whisper of belief grows stronger when it’s followed with intent. What would shift if you moved with purpose, even before the confidence arrives?"

The Traveler: "But what if I’m just being unrealistic? The drawn card is 'XVII - The Star (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The upright Star is hope, inspiration, and spiritual direction — realism matters, but so does vision. What if this dream isn’t foolish, but the thread leading you to your most honest life?"

The Traveler: "This is my final question. How do I know if this dream is really mine? The drawn card is 'X - The Wheel of Fortune (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The upright Wheel of Fortune reflects cycles, fate, and divine timing — when something keeps returning to your heart, despite fear or delay, it’s rarely by accident. Sometimes the dream chooses you."
