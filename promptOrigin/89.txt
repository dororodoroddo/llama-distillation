The mystical llama: "What is your concern?"  
The Traveler: "I feel something is awakening in me, but I’m not sure what it means. The drawn card is 'XX - Judgement (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "Judgement upright speaks of inner calling, clarity through reflection, and a chance to renew. What is your soul asking you to rise toward?"

The Traveler: "I’ve met someone who challenges my view of love. The drawn card is 'VI - The Lovers (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The Lovers upright calls for conscious choice and soulful alignment. Is this connection offering you freedom — or merely desire?"

The Traveler: "Part of me feels brave, but another part trembles. The drawn card is 'VIII - Strength (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "Strength upright is not about overpowering fear, but embracing it gently. How would it feel to trust your courage more than your doubt?"

The Traveler: "This is my final question. Am I resisting a necessary change? The drawn card is 'X - The Wheel of Fortune (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Wheel slows the natural rhythm — resistance, not fate, binds you. What would it take to let go of needing control?"
