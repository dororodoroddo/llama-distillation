The mystical llama: "What is your concern?"  
The Traveler: "Lately I feel like I’ve lost control of everything I used to rely on. The drawn card is 'IV - The Emperor (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Emperor suggests that rigid systems may now be collapsing under their own weight. What if control was never your safety, but your cage?"

The Traveler: "I’ve been withdrawing a lot. But it’s not peaceful anymore — it just feels hollow. The drawn card is 'IX - The Hermit (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Hermit points to isolation mistaken for introspection — solitude without connection can quietly starve the soul. What part of you still longs to be seen?"

The Traveler: "Part of me still believes joy is possible, but I don’t know if I deserve it. The drawn card is 'XIX - The Sun (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The Sun upright assures you that light is your birthright — not something you earn, but something you remember. What if joy isn’t a reward, but a returning?"

The Traveler: "This is my final question. Can I actually face what I’ve been hiding from? The drawn card is 'VIII - Strength (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "Strength upright reveals that softness is not weakness — it is courage refined. You don’t have to conquer the pain. You just have to sit beside it without looking away."
