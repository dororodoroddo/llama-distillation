The mystical llama: "What is your concern?"  
The Traveler: "I’ve lost hope. Things used to feel possible — now it all feels far away. The drawn card is 'XVII - The Star (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Star dims your inner light, clouding what still shines. What small spark of belief are you willing to hold, even now?"

The Traveler: "I try to keep the peace, but it feels like I’m just avoiding conflict. The drawn card is 'XIV - Temperance (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "Temperance reversed warns of imbalance and suppression — peace without honesty breeds pressure. What truth is swelling beneath your calm?"

The Traveler: "Change is coming whether I want it or not. The drawn card is 'XIII - Death (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The upright Death clears what’s finished — not to harm, but to make space. What must be released for your soul to breathe again?"

The Traveler: "This is my final question. Can I step into something new with confidence? The drawn card is 'I - The Magician (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The Magician upright stands at the edge of creation — your tools are ready, your heart is calling. What would happen if you trusted your own hands?"
