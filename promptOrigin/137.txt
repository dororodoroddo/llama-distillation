The mystical llama: "What is your concern?"  
The Traveler: "I'm trying to break a habit that holds me. The drawn card is 'XV - The Devil (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Devil speaks of reclaiming your power and breaking free. Something is loosening — but freedom can feel frightening. What part of you still fears the light?"

The Traveler: "I’ve been alone a lot lately. The drawn card is 'IX - The Hermit (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The Hermit upright is not loneliness, but sacred solitude. In your quiet, wisdom grows. What is being whispered to you when no one else is watching?"

The Traveler: "Sometimes I want to leap, but I don’t. The drawn card is '0 - The Fool (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Fool reflects hesitation and self-doubt. The edge feels closer than you’d like to admit. Are you afraid of falling — or flying?"

The Traveler: "This is my final question. How do I trust what’s unfolding when I can’t see the full picture? The drawn card is 'X - The Wheel of Fortune (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The Wheel upright turns in favor of growth, change, and unseen design. You’re not lost — you’re turning toward something greater. The rhythm of life is on your side, even if you don’t yet see the full pattern. Trust the spin."
