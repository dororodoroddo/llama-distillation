The mystical llama: "What is your concern?"  
The Traveler: "I want peace, but I don’t know how to find it. The drawn card is 'XIV - Temperance (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "Temperance upright calls for gentle integration, the sacred middle path. Your longing for peace is itself a prayer — and you’re already walking the answer. What are you willing to soften, just a little, today?"

The Traveler: "I’ve been guided by instinct lately. The drawn card is 'II - The High Priestess (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The High Priestess brings you into mystery, sacred silence, and inner knowing. What you sense but can’t explain may be more real than what you can name. Will you trust the whisper over the noise?"

The Traveler: "I think I’ve completed a cycle. The drawn card is 'XXI - The World (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The World upright celebrates fulfillment and totality. You’ve reached a beautiful threshold — but the next step requires gratitude, not grasping. What would it feel like to honor this ending before rushing into what's next?"

The Traveler: "This is my final question. How can I begin again without fear of repeating the past? The drawn card is '0 - The Fool (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Fool invites caution, not fear. Something new is calling, but hesitation clouds your leap. It’s okay to wait, as long as you're not waiting forever. Trust returns when you hold both excitement and discernment together."
