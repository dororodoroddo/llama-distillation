The mystical llama: "What is your concern?"  
The Traveler: "I’m feeling something stir deep in me — like I’m supposed to do something greater. The drawn card is 'XX - Judgement (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "Judgement upright is a call to rise — to answer what your soul already knows. What truth are you finally willing to live by?"

The Traveler: "But my thoughts are scattered, like I can’t see clearly. The drawn card is 'XVIII - The Moon (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Moon reveals illusions lifting — but also fear of what’s behind the veil. What truth are you most afraid of discovering?"

The Traveler: "Still, I feel this drive to push forward anyway. The drawn card is 'VII - The Chariot (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The Chariot upright is focused will and forward motion — but the road must be chosen, not rushed. What’s the destination that truly calls to you?"

The Traveler: "This is my final question. Can I be the one to lead this path, even without support? The drawn card is 'IV - The Emperor (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Emperor speaks of shaken authority — but your doubt doesn’t erase your potential. What would stepping into your power look like, even imperfectly?"
