The mystical llama: "What is your concern?"  
The Traveler: "I want to start over, but fear keeps getting in the way. The drawn card is '0 - The Fool (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Fool hesitates at the edge — unsure whether the fall will lead to flight. Is it fear of the unknown, or fear of becoming someone new?"

The Traveler: "I try to control everything, but it’s exhausting. The drawn card is 'VII - The Chariot (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Chariot reveals struggle between direction and surrender. When you grip too tightly, the wheels grind. What would trust look like right now?"

The Traveler: "Even through all this, I still want to reach fulfillment. The drawn card is 'XXI - The World (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The World upright speaks of completion and integration. Every step, even the missteps, is part of your return. What if you're already closer than you think?"

The Traveler: "This is my final question. What must I build to feel safe in moving forward? The drawn card is 'IV - The Emperor (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The Emperor offers structure, clarity, and sovereignty. To move forward, you must take your seat in the center — calm, certain, and steady."
