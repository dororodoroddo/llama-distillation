The mystical llama: "What is your concern?"  
The Traveler: "I’ve been moving in circles, feeling like nothing I do gains traction. The drawn card is 'VII - The Chariot (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Chariot speaks of scattered will and misaligned direction — the wheels spin, but the path is unclear. What desire are you chasing that no longer leads you?"

The Traveler: "And creatively… I feel completely blocked. The drawn card is 'III - The Empress (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Empress reflects a disconnect from your inner rhythm — inspiration grows where softness and trust are restored. What if your stillness is not laziness, but fallow ground?"

The Traveler: "Still, I want to do the right thing. I want to make fair decisions. The drawn card is 'XI - Justice (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "Justice upright is balance between truth and consequence. What would it mean to be honest not only with others, but with yourself?"

The Traveler: "This is my final question. Can I begin again, even now? The drawn card is '0 - The Fool (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The upright Fool carries no shame in beginning — only wonder. What if your first step didn’t need certainty, just courage?"
