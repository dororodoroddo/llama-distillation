The mystical llama: "What is your concern?"  
The Traveler: "I’m confused about everything lately. My thoughts feel cloudy, and I can’t tell what’s real. The drawn card is 'XVIII - The Moon (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Moon signals the fog beginning to lift — confusion is not weakness, but the cost of carrying too many voices at once. What quiet truth begins to form when you stop trying to explain yourself?"

The Traveler: "I want to break away and do something new, but I feel unprepared. The drawn card is '0 - The Fool (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "Reversed Fool reflects hesitation, not failure — the fear of misstep can keep you at the edge of the cliff forever. What would shift if you took one small step, even without knowing where it leads?"

The Traveler: "And what if my heart is wrong about who I love? The drawn card is 'VI - The Lovers (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Lovers speaks to disharmony — not always between two people, but between your desire and your fear. What might happen if you stopped judging your heart for being uncertain?"

The Traveler: "This is my final question. Will I ever feel balanced again? The drawn card is 'XIV - Temperance (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "Temperance reminds you that balance is not a state, but a practice — daily, imperfect, and gentle. Peace does not arrive all at once; it returns one breath at a time."
