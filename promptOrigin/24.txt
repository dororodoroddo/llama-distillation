The mystical llama: "What is your concern?"  
The Traveler: "Everything keeps shifting — I can’t seem to find solid ground. The drawn card is 'X - The Wheel of Fortune (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Wheel reflects a fear of the uncontrollable — but life’s rhythm is not chaos; it’s conversation. What are you resisting that might actually be inviting you forward?"

The Traveler: "I feel weak all the time. Not in body, but like I’ve lost my ability to handle anything. The drawn card is 'VIII - Strength (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "Reversed Strength reveals the fatigue of always holding yourself together. You are not weak — you are tired of pretending to be invulnerable. What part of you longs to be seen in its softness?"

The Traveler: "Something ended recently, and I don’t know who I am without it. The drawn card is 'XIII - Death (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "Death upright marks release, not erasure — a door has closed, yes, but only to reveal another. Who might you become now that this weight no longer defines you?"

The Traveler: "This is my final question. How do I recover my inner balance? The drawn card is 'XIV - Temperance (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Temperance warns against rushing back into equilibrium — balance cannot be forced. Let your extremes breathe. In time, they will return to center on their own."
