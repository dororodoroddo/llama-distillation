The mystical llama: "What is your concern?"  
The Traveler: "Lately I feel like I’m not evolving. The drawn card is 'XXI - The World (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The World upright suggests you’re reaching a moment of culmination — but with that comes the question: what comes after arrival?"

The Traveler: "There’s a part of me that doubts my inner voice. The drawn card is 'II - The High Priestess (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed High Priestess points to ignored intuition or inner silence. Your knowing is still there — gently knocking. Will you open the door?"

The Traveler: "It feels like everything is collapsing. The drawn card is 'XVI - The Tower (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The Tower upright destroys illusions to reveal foundations. It’s not betrayal — it’s truth breaking through. What were you building that could never hold?"

The Traveler: "This is my final question. How can I regain balance after so much upheaval? The drawn card is 'XIV - Temperance (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "Temperance reversed closes this chapter with a message of disharmony. The balance you seek won’t come from control, but release. Let the pieces find each other without force — they still know how to belong."
