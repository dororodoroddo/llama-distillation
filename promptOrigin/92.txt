The mystical llama: "What is your concern?"  
The Traveler: "I want to begin a new project, but I’m not sure if I’m ready. The drawn card is 'I - The Magician (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The upright Magician affirms your readiness — your talents are aligned, your will is strong. What’s stopping you from claiming your power?"

The Traveler: "I also feel like I’m not seeing the full picture. The drawn card is 'XVIII - The Moon (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Moon reveals confusion clearing, or illusions lingering. What truth have you glimpsed that still feels hard to accept?"

The Traveler: "Sometimes I fear I won’t be treated fairly if I fail. The drawn card is 'XI - Justice (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Justice warns of inner or outer bias. Are you holding yourself to a harsher standard than others ever would?"

The Traveler: "This is my final question. Can I still find clarity and hope? The drawn card is 'XVII - The Star (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The Star upright is renewal, inspiration, and soft healing light. What would shift if you believed your future still holds beauty?"
