The mystical llama: "What is your concern?"  
The Traveler: "Everything in my life feels like it’s collapsing… nothing is stable anymore. The drawn card is 'XVI - The Tower (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The upright Tower brings sudden upheaval — not as punishment, but as release. What if the collapse is clearing space for what’s truly yours?"

The Traveler: "I’ve been trying to take control of it all, but the pressure is enormous. The drawn card is 'VII - The Chariot (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The Chariot upright urges determination and will — but even strength must be steered wisely. Are you pushing forward from power, or from fear of standing still?"

The Traveler: "I know there are unhealthy ties I need to cut, but part of me resists. The drawn card is 'XV - The Devil (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Devil reveals awareness of the chain, and the chance to break it. What illusion are you still calling comfort?"

The Traveler: "This is my final question. Why do I keep feeling powerless, even when I try to stand firm? The drawn card is 'IV - The Emperor (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Emperor speaks of shaky foundations and misplaced authority. What might shift if you redefined strength as consistency, not control?"
