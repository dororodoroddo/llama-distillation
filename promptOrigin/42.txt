The mystical llama: "What is your concern?"  
The Traveler: "I keep repeating a pattern that I know is hurting me. The drawn card is 'XV - The Devil (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The upright Devil reveals attachment that feels safe but stifles your spirit. What are you afraid would happen if you finally let go?"

The Traveler: "Sometimes I sense something deeper inside me, but I can’t quite reach it. The drawn card is 'II - The High Priestess (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The High Priestess represents intuition, stillness, and hidden truth. Your inner voice is whispering — are you listening closely enough to hear it?"

The Traveler: "I know I need to let go, but I hesitate. The drawn card is 'XII - The Hanged Man (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The Hanged Man calls for surrender and a shift in perspective. What might you see if you stopped trying to force your way through?"

The Traveler: "This is my final question. Do I have enough within me to begin again? The drawn card is 'I - The Magician (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The upright Magician says yes — not because you're perfect, but because you are willing. What could you create if you believed that you already have what you need?"
