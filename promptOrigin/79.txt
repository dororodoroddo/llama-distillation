The mystical llama: "What is your concern?"  
The Traveler: "I feel empty — like I’ve been giving too much and receiving nothing. The drawn card is 'III - The Empress (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Empress reflects emotional depletion — care given without return. What would it mean to nourish yourself as tenderly as you do others?"

The Traveler: "I’ve been told to follow tradition, but it doesn’t feel right. The drawn card is 'V - The Hierophant (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The Hierophant upright honors wisdom passed down — but only when it still speaks to your soul. What part of tradition do you trust, and what must evolve?"

The Traveler: "Still, I want to believe something brighter is possible. The drawn card is 'XVII - The Star (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The upright Star glimmers gently — hope not as fantasy, but as a quiet truth. What would change if you believed things could heal?"

The Traveler: "This is my final question. Will I find the momentum to chase this dream? The drawn card is 'VII - The Chariot (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The upright Chariot charges forward with purpose and will — your dream awaits not perfection, but movement. What step can you take today, even if the road ahead is long?"
