The mystical llama: "What is your concern?"  
The Traveler: "I’ve been trying to maintain balance in my life. The drawn card is 'XIV - Temperance (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "Temperance upright brings harmony through patience and integration. You are learning how to blend opposites into peace. Keep choosing steady, intentional steps — your quiet efforts are shaping something beautiful."

The Traveler: "But I still feel chained to something I know is unhealthy. The drawn card is 'XV - The Devil (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The upright Devil reveals temptation, obsession, or self-imposed limitation. A part of you may be clinging to comfort disguised as control. What would it take to see the chains as illusions — and begin releasing yourself?"

The Traveler: "I think I’m finally ready to let go. The drawn card is 'XIII - Death (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "Death upright marks powerful transformation. This is not an end, but a passage into renewal. As you shed old skins, remember — loss creates space for truth to grow. What might rise from the ashes if you allow the flame?"

The Traveler: "This is my final question. How can I face what’s collapsing inside me? The drawn card is 'XVI - The Tower (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Tower speaks of a quiet collapse or inner upheaval not yet acknowledged. Even if the outer world appears stable, you know something is shifting deep within. Allow the crumbling — and let your new foundations be born from honesty, not fear."
