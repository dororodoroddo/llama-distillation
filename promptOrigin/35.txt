The mystical llama: "What is your concern?"  
The Traveler: "There’s someone I’m drawn to… but I don’t know if it’s love or something else. The drawn card is 'VI - The Lovers (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The Lovers upright speaks of true alignment — but also asks you to choose with full awareness. Is your heart speaking clearly, or are you still asking it for permission?"

The Traveler: "I’m afraid of making the wrong choice, like I’ll disappoint what I’ve been taught to believe. The drawn card is 'V - The Hierophant (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The Hierophant upright honors tradition — but also challenges you to find what’s sacred to *you*. Are you living a truth that still feels alive, or just familiar?"

The Traveler: "Everything changed so suddenly between us, and now I don’t know what’s left. The drawn card is 'XIII - Death (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "Death upright brings transformation, not just loss — something old has ended, but that ending made space. What truth can now breathe without the weight of what used to be?"

The Traveler: "This is my final question. Why does it all feel uncertain even now? The drawn card is 'XVIII - The Moon (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Moon reflects confusion lifting — but only if you stop chasing clarity and let it find you. What if peace isn’t knowing everything, but trusting what you already feel?"
