The mystical llama: "What is your concern?"  
The Traveler: "I want to begin something, but I’m hesitating. The drawn card is '0 - The Fool (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Fool reflects fear of missteps or reckless leaps. You may be standing still out of self-protection. Yet in stillness, the longing only grows. What would it take to believe in your own wings?"

The Traveler: "I keep trying to find balance, but nothing holds. The drawn card is 'XIV - Temperance (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Temperance warns of imbalance, haste, or refusal to blend. You’re rushing toward resolution, but harmony takes time. What if you focused less on fixing — and more on listening?"

The Traveler: "I can’t seem to move forward. The drawn card is 'VII - The Chariot (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Chariot reflects stalled momentum and inner division. Perhaps you're chasing a goal that no longer resonates. Before moving, ask: is the direction aligned with who you are becoming?"

The Traveler: "This is my final question. How can I believe again when the light feels gone? The drawn card is 'XVII - The Star (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Star reveals blocked hope or disbelief in your own light. But your glow has not gone out — it’s simply dimmed by fear. Let even a flicker guide you. Hope will return if you make space for its arrival."
