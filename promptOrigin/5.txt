The mystical llama: "What is your concern?"  
The Traveler: "I feel like I'm losing control over my emotions these days. The drawn card is 'VIII - Strength (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The upright Strength may seem ironic here — it speaks not of suppression, but of quiet mastery through compassion. You’re not meant to conquer your feelings, but to coexist with them gently. Are you trying to silence what actually needs to be heard?"

The Traveler: "That makes sense… I’ve been forcing myself to stay composed. The drawn card is 'IV - The Emperor (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The upright Emperor reflects order, responsibility, and structure — perhaps you've built too many rules around how you 'should' feel. What part of your emotional world has been denied its place at your table?"

The Traveler: "Maybe the fear that if I let go, everything will fall apart. The drawn card is 'XVIII - The Moon (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The Moon brings up uncertainty, illusions, and deep emotional tides — but within that confusion lies intuition’s whisper. What would happen if, instead of trying to clarify everything, you simply stayed with the mystery a little longer?"

The Traveler: "This is my final question. Will I ever feel emotionally safe again? The drawn card is 'X - The Wheel of Fortune (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The Wheel of Fortune reminds us that everything turns — no state is final, no emotion permanent. Emotional safety returns not by control, but by learning to ride the rhythm of change with trust."
