The mystical llama: "What is your concern?"  
The Traveler: "I’m in love, but I don’t know if it’s real or just the idea of love. The drawn card is 'VI - The Lovers (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The Lovers upright represents real choice — not just chemistry, but alignment. Is your heart speaking, or is your loneliness whispering louder?"

The Traveler: "There’s a part of me that knows this isn’t healthy, but I still stay. The drawn card is 'XV - The Devil (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Devil hints at growing awareness — you're not trapped, but part of you fears freedom. What might your life look like without this hold?"

The Traveler: "Still… a piece of me wants to nurture this into something better. The drawn card is 'III - The Empress (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The Empress invites compassion, creation, and self-worth. Can you offer love to yourself with the same gentleness you’re offering them?"

The Traveler: "This is my final question. Am I retreating into myself again out of fear? The drawn card is 'IX - The Hermit (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Hermit withdraws not for wisdom, but for avoidance. What truth are you hoping to outrun by disappearing?"
