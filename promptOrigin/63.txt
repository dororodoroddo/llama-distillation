The mystical llama: "What is your concern?"  
The Traveler: "My dreams feel distant lately, like I’ve lost the thread. The drawn card is 'XVIII - The Moon (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The upright Moon obscures clarity with emotion — not to confuse, but to reveal hidden tides. What feeling are you avoiding that could guide you back?"

The Traveler: "I feel like I missed my moment… like I didn’t rise when called. The drawn card is 'XX - Judgement (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "Judgement reversed whispers of a call unanswered — not denied, just delayed. What fear held you back from choosing your truth?"

The Traveler: "Now I’m trying to do the right thing, even if it’s painful. The drawn card is 'XI - Justice (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "Justice upright sees with open eyes and steady heart — it cuts gently but cleanly. What outcome are you still weighing in your soul?"

The Traveler: "This is my final question. Is it too late to start again? The drawn card is '0 - The Fool (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Fool fears foolishness more than failure — but all beginnings risk being wrong. What might happen if you trusted the leap more than the landing?"
