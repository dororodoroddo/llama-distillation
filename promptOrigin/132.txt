The mystical llama: "What is your concern?"  
The Traveler: "I’m trying to stay balanced. The drawn card is 'XIV - Temperance (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "Temperance upright encourages harmony, blending, and patience. You're already holding opposing forces with grace. The question now is — can you be just as gentle with yourself?"

The Traveler: "But I feel like the world keeps shifting under me. The drawn card is 'X - The Wheel of Fortune (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Wheel reflects disruptions, setbacks, or unexpected turns. But chaos doesn't mean failure — it means transformation is underway. What if the detour is the real path?"

The Traveler: "Still, something is working in my favor. The drawn card is 'X - The Wheel of Fortune (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The Wheel upright spins in your favor — aligning you with fate, flow, and unseen timing. This is a reminder: some things turn without your control, but always in rhythm with what’s next."

The Traveler: "This is my final question. How do I turn all of this into something real? The drawn card is 'IV - The Emperor (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The Emperor upright returns to offer structure and strength. Now is the time to take the insight you've gathered and create form. Lead with clarity — and build what truly lasts."
