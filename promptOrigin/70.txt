The mystical llama: "What is your concern?"  
The Traveler: "Something has ended… I feel it in my bones. The drawn card is 'XIII - Death (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "Death upright marks transition, not disappearance — the echo of what was making space for what may be. What are you ready to grieve and grow from?"

The Traveler: "Despite that, I still hope for something better ahead. The drawn card is 'XVII - The Star (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The Star upright shines even through ruins — a gentle reminder that light survives. What would happen if you dared to dream, again?"

The Traveler: "And love… I think it might be returning. The drawn card is 'VI - The Lovers (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The Lovers upright speaks of union and deep choice — a harmony both emotional and deliberate. What are you ready to choose with your whole heart?"

The Traveler: "This is my final question. Will I ever feel whole again? The drawn card is 'XX - Judgement (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "Judgement reversed holds the weight of self-doubt — but you are not your past silence. Wholeness begins when you stop asking if you're worthy, and start remembering that you are."
