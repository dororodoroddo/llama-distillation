The mystical llama: "What is your concern?"  
The Traveler: "I thought this connection was real, but now I’m unsure. The drawn card is 'VI - The Lovers (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Lovers show disharmony, misalignment, or confusion in relationships. This isn’t about blame — it’s about clarity. What part of you is not being met?"

The Traveler: "I feel like something important is ending. The drawn card is 'XIII - Death (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "Death upright offers transformation through release. Something is ending, yes — but what it clears is sacred. What could begin if you allowed the end to fully arrive?"

The Traveler: "It’s hard to let go even when I know I should. The drawn card is 'XIII - Death (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The repetition of Death calls louder — release is no longer optional. You’re being asked to shed, not to be cruel, but to be free. Let the old fall. You are ready."

The Traveler: "This is my final question. How do I build truth after letting go of what I thought was right? The drawn card is 'V - The Hierophant (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Hierophant questions traditions, structures, and inherited beliefs. You’re being invited to make your own truth, outside the rules you once followed. You are your own authority now. Let your soul speak first."
