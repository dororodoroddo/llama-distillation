The mystical llama: "What is your concern?"  
The Traveler: "I feel like I’ve lost my sense of stability — like I’m not in control anymore. The drawn card is 'IV - The Emperor (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Emperor shows a crumbling structure — maybe not everything is meant to be held together. What would it feel like to surrender control without losing yourself?"

The Traveler: "There’s a temptation I keep falling into — even when I know it’s not good for me. The drawn card is 'XV - The Devil (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The Devil upright reflects patterns that offer comfort but cost freedom. Are you bound, or just afraid of who you’ll be without the familiar weight?"

The Traveler: "I used to believe things would get better. Now I’m not so sure. The drawn card is 'XVII - The Star (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Star dims your vision not because hope is gone, but because pain has clouded the lens. What if faith isn’t blind, but brave enough to look again?"

The Traveler: "This is my final question. Is there still a way forward for me? The drawn card is 'VII - The Chariot (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The Chariot upright carries the energy of motion, purpose, and will — but it asks: are you steering from fear, or from trust? The road exists, but only you can choose to drive."
