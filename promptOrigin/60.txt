The mystical llama: "What is your concern?"  
The Traveler: "My hope has been dim lately, even though I’m trying to hold on. The drawn card is 'XVII - The Star (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Star flickers, not disappears — the night feels longer than it is. What would it take to believe that light hasn’t left you?"

The Traveler: "I want to do what’s right, even if I’m not sure what that is. The drawn card is 'XI - Justice (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "Justice upright seeks balance and clarity — but not always comfort. What’s the truth you already know but haven’t named?"

The Traveler: "I’ve been trying to push forward, to not let doubt win. The drawn card is 'VII - The Chariot (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The Chariot upright is forward motion fueled by focus — but true control comes from within. What fear still sits in the driver’s seat?"

The Traveler: "This is my final question. Should I trust my own voice over what others expect of me? The drawn card is 'V - The Hierophant (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Hierophant urges you to walk your path, not trace someone else’s. What belief is yours, even if no one else agrees?"
