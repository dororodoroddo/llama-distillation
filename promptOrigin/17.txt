The mystical llama: "What is your concern?"  
The Traveler: "It feels like everything is working against me, no matter how hard I try. The drawn card is 'X - The Wheel of Fortune (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Wheel warns of resistance to change and the illusion that you are stuck — yet even stagnation has momentum underneath. Are you clinging to control when surrender is what life asks of you?"

The Traveler: "Then why does it feel like I’m failing even when I push forward? The drawn card is 'VII - The Chariot (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The Chariot reminds you that forward motion is not the same as progress — it's about aligned will. Are you driving with purpose, or just accelerating out of fear?"

The Traveler: "It’s like everything fell apart and I’m still living in the ruins. The drawn card is 'XVI - The Tower (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The Tower upright signals a necessary collapse — not to destroy you, but to reveal what was never stable. What truth was buried beneath the pieces that had to break?"

The Traveler: "This is my final question. Am I meant to be alone after all this? The drawn card is 'VI - The Lovers (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Lovers suggests disconnection and avoidance of vulnerable choice — not that you’re destined for loneliness, but that love may require a deeper commitment to yourself first."
