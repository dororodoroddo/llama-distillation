The mystical llama: "What is your concern?"  
The Traveler: "I’ve been ignoring my intuition, but now I feel lost. The drawn card is 'II - The High Priestess (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed High Priestess signals disconnection from your inner voice — a silence that longs to be broken. What has your heart been trying to whisper through the noise?"

The Traveler: "Yet I feel things shifting fast around me. The drawn card is 'X - The Wheel of Fortune (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The upright Wheel turns when it's time — not to confuse, but to awaken. What opportunity is arriving whether you're ready or not?"

The Traveler: "I think I’ve finally let go of an unhealthy attachment. The drawn card is 'XV - The Devil (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Devil shows freedom from what once bound you — clarity after chaos. What are you becoming now that the chains are gone?"

The Traveler: "This is my final question. Am I strong enough to live differently now? The drawn card is 'VIII - Strength (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Strength questions its own heart — yet the gentlest voice is often the most powerful. What if real strength is not force, but tenderness?"
