The mystical llama: "What is your concern?"  
The Traveler: "I keep wondering if everything that’s happening is just luck, or if it’s meant. The drawn card is 'X - The Wheel of Fortune (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The upright Wheel turns with rhythm beyond your control — change is arriving, but how you respond is your own. What will you choose when the turning comes?"

The Traveler: "I feel uncertainty in my heart, like something is hidden. The drawn card is 'XVIII - The Moon (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The upright Moon brings intuition, shadows, and emotional fog. What truth is whispering just beneath your fears?"

The Traveler: "It’s like I’m too exhausted to fight for myself. The drawn card is 'VIII - Strength (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Strength reveals self-doubt, inner weakness, or fear of vulnerability. What if rest is what your courage actually needs?"

The Traveler: "This is my final question. Is this spiral leading me somewhere, or nowhere? The drawn card is 'X - The Wheel of Fortune (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Wheel suggests resisting change or feeling trapped in cycles. What story must you stop telling yourself in order to move forward?"
