The mystical llama: "What is your concern?"  
The Traveler: "Everything’s falling apart, and I can’t stop it. The drawn card is 'XVI - The Tower (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The upright Tower breaks what is no longer sustainable — destruction as revelation. What truth is emerging from the rubble?"

The Traveler: "I feel the need to take control, but I’m unsure if that’s right. The drawn card is 'IV - The Emperor (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The Emperor upright stands firm — a symbol of structure and authority. What order could you build, not to contain chaos, but to anchor your strength?"

The Traveler: "To move forward, I feel I need a new perspective. The drawn card is 'XII - The Hanged Man (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The upright Hanged Man offers wisdom in stillness — pause as transformation. What might shift if you stopped reacting, and started witnessing?"

The Traveler: "This is my final question. Can I finally break free from old patterns? The drawn card is 'XV - The Devil (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Devil speaks of release — a chain unfastened by choice. What would freedom look like if you believed you deserved it?"
