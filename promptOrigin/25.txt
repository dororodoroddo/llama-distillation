The mystical llama: "What is your concern?"  
The Traveler: "Everything I relied on fell apart so quickly. I didn’t even see it coming. The drawn card is 'XVI - The Tower (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The Tower upright doesn’t destroy without purpose — it clears space for what was buried under illusion. What truth now has room to rise from the wreckage?"

The Traveler: "Even now, I feel like I can’t trust my own instincts. The drawn card is 'II - The High Priestess (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed High Priestess shows suppressed intuition and self-silencing — doubt may not come from unknowing, but from refusing what you already sensed. What would it mean to believe yourself again?"

The Traveler: "I’ve lost my joy. Nothing feels bright anymore. The drawn card is 'XIX - The Sun (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Sun dims, but does not disappear — it hides behind unmet emotions, not failure. Joy may be waiting in the simplest places, if you stop expecting it to look how it used to."

The Traveler: "This is my final question. Can I still create something meaningful from where I am? The drawn card is 'I - The Magician (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Magician reminds you: tools without belief are just objects. Creation begins not when everything is ready, but when you stop waiting for proof and begin anyway."
