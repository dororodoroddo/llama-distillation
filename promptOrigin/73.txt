The mystical llama: "What is your concern?"  
The Traveler: "Even in despair, I feel something calling me forward. The drawn card is 'XVII - The Star (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The Star upright whispers quietly in the dark — not a shout, but a promise. What are you still willing to believe in?"

The Traveler: "To listen, I know I have to slow down. The drawn card is 'XII - The Hanged Man (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The upright Hanged Man invites surrender — perspective that can only come through stillness. What might be revealed if you stopped trying to force the answer?"

The Traveler: "There’s someone I want to love deeply — it feels important. The drawn card is 'VI - The Lovers (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The Lovers upright speaks of aligned hearts and conscious choice — love that’s sacred through intention. What truth would your heart choose, if you stopped being afraid?"

The Traveler: "This is my final question. Do I have the power to bring this vision to life? The drawn card is 'I - The Magician (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Magician forgets his tools when he doubts himself — power still present, but unused. What would change if you believed you already had everything you need?"
