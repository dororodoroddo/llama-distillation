The mystical llama: "What is your concern?"  
The Traveler: "I can’t stop isolating myself. The drawn card is 'IX - The Hermit (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Hermit repeats a message of distance, not reflection. You are not hiding to heal — you are hiding to disappear. What would it take to be seen again?"

The Traveler: "Something in my life just won’t resolve. The drawn card is 'XXI - The World (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed World points to a cycle on repeat. There’s one lesson left, one door not yet closed. What remains unspoken in your story?"

The Traveler: "I know I should let go, but I haven’t. The drawn card is 'XIII - Death (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Death holds fear of finality. But you’re already standing in the in-between. What if crossing the threshold is the only way to breathe again?"

The Traveler: "This is my final question. Can I trust where my heart is leading me? The drawn card is 'XVIII - The Moon (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The Moon upright reveals emotional depth, shadows, and hidden truths. You’re not lost — you’re dreaming forward. Let mystery guide you, and trust what is soft, even when logic cannot explain the pull."
