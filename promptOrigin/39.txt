The mystical llama: "What is your concern?"  
The Traveler: "I’m trying to stay grounded, but I feel overwhelmed by what’s ahead. The drawn card is 'VIII - Strength (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "Strength upright whispers that gentleness can anchor you through storm. What would change if you held yourself with tenderness instead of pressure?"

The Traveler: "I keep hearing a call for change, but I’m afraid to answer. The drawn card is 'XX - Judgement (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "Judgement upright is the soul’s invitation to rise — not to escape the past, but to integrate it. What truth keeps knocking, even when you try to ignore it?"

The Traveler: "I thought I had found balance, but everything feels off again. The drawn card is 'XIV - Temperance (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "Reversed Temperance reveals imbalance not as failure, but as a signal — your needs may have changed. What part of your life feels poured too thin?"

The Traveler: "This is my final question. Am I losing touch with my own potential? The drawn card is 'I - The Magician (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Magician reflects self-doubt clouding clarity — but your tools haven’t disappeared, only your trust in them. What would happen if you acted as if you remembered your power?"
