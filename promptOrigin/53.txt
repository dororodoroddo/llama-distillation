The mystical llama: "What is your concern?"  
The Traveler: "I’ve chosen to be alone lately… not sure if it’s helping. The drawn card is 'IX - The Hermit (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The Hermit upright brings solitude that reveals inner truth. Are you isolating to heal — or hiding from the world that might challenge you?"

The Traveler: "I feel like something major already crumbled, but I still can’t rebuild. The drawn card is 'XVI - The Tower (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Tower shows resistance to starting anew after the fall. What part of the ruins are you still clinging to?"

The Traveler: "I’ve been waiting, hoping something will shift on its own. The drawn card is 'XII - The Hanged Man (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The Hanged Man speaks of surrender — waiting with purpose, not passivity. What might happen if you chose to release, not just pause?"

The Traveler: "This is my final question. Is it still right to wait, or must I move forward now? The drawn card is 'XII - The Hanged Man (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The Hanged Man returns — perhaps to show that the pause still holds wisdom. But has reflection become avoidance? What would action with clarity look like?"
