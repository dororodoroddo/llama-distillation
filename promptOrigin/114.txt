The mystical llama: "What is your concern?"  
The Traveler: "I’m unsure what to believe anymore. The drawn card is 'XVII - The Star (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Star suggests disillusionment, a dimming of your inner light. You may feel cut off from what once gave you meaning. Yet the ember still glows — where in your life have you forgotten to look for hope?"

The Traveler: "I’ve been feeling judged — by others and myself. The drawn card is 'XX - Judgement (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Judgement speaks of self-doubt and the refusal to answer your higher calling. Guilt may be holding you in place. What might shift if you forgave yourself enough to move forward?"

The Traveler: "I feel like I’m not learning the lesson I’m supposed to. The drawn card is 'XII - The Hanged Man (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Hanged Man warns of stubbornness or resisting a needed shift in perception. You may be asking for change without giving something up. What old truth are you afraid to release?"

The Traveler: "This is my final question. How do I move forward when I feel so far behind? The drawn card is 'VII - The Chariot (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The upright Chariot arrives to carry you onward. Though your journey has been heavy, you are not broken — you are becoming. Willpower and focus now gather behind you like wind in a sail. Choose your path, and let movement be your healing."
