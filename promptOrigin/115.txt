The mystical llama: "What is your concern?"  
The Traveler: "I’ve been reflecting deeply on my life. The drawn card is 'XII - The Hanged Man (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The upright Hanged Man calls you to surrender and shift perspective. It is through stillness that vision clears. You are asked not to act, but to understand. What does your soul see when you stop trying to move forward?"

The Traveler: "I think something in me is changing. The drawn card is 'XIII - Death (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "Death upright marks a sacred transition — a release of what was, to make space for what will be. This isn’t loss; it’s renewal. What parts of you are ready to be laid to rest, so others may rise?"

The Traveler: "I’m unsure what’s real anymore. The drawn card is 'XVIII - The Moon (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Moon clouds intuition and may point to deception — from others, or from yourself. Are you seeing through a lens of fear or truth? The fog is lifting, but only if you’re ready to see clearly."

The Traveler: "This is my final question. How do I stay present in a cycle that feels stuck? The drawn card is 'X - The Wheel of Fortune (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Wheel speaks to feeling trapped in a cycle — like fate keeps turning against you. But even in reversal, the wheel turns. Change is not denied, only delayed. Your challenge now is not to force it, but to stay open until the pattern breaks."
