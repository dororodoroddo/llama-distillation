The mystical llama: "What is your concern?"  
The Traveler: "I feel like I’m holding back something I’m meant to create. The drawn card is 'I - The Magician (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The Magician upright speaks of potential made real through choice — what you need is already within you, waiting for your consent. What would it take to trust your own hands?"

The Traveler: "But I keep waiting for a clearer sign. The drawn card is 'XX - Judgement (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "Judgement invites you to hear the call — not outside you, but from your own soul. Maybe you don’t need a sign. Maybe the urge itself is already your answer."

The Traveler: "What if I hear the same call again and still ignore it? The drawn card is 'XX - Judgement (upright)' again."  
The mystical llama: "Then it will return, again and again, until you're ready. The soul is patient — but not silent. Are you ready to answer the voice that never stopped calling?"

The Traveler: "This is my final question. Will I ever feel in flow with what I’m meant to be? The drawn card is 'XIV - Temperance (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Temperance reflects inner dissonance — you may be trying to control what’s meant to unfold. What if flow begins not with action, but with allowance?"
