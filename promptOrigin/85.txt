The mystical llama: "What is your concern?"  
The Traveler: "I feel like a fraud — like I’ve been pretending to be capable. The drawn card is 'I - The Magician (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Magician hides from their own power — fearing exposure. What if your self-doubt is only a shadow of your potential?"

The Traveler: "I’ve been feeling a pull toward something bigger than me. The drawn card is 'XX - Judgement (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "Judgement upright calls for awakening, reflection, and rebirth. What truth is rising in you that refuses to be silenced?"

The Traveler: "But life keeps crumbling around me. The drawn card is 'XVI - The Tower (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The upright Tower is divine upheaval — not cruelty, but clearing. What are you being asked to let go of, no matter how tightly you held it?"

The Traveler: "This is my final question. Will something beautiful come from this destruction? The drawn card is 'XIII - Death (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "Death upright ends what is done — not with punishment, but promise. What might begin, now that you’ve laid the past to rest?"
