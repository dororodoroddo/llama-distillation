The mystical llama: "What is your concern?"  
The Traveler: "I want to find emotional balance again. The drawn card is 'XIV - Temperance (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "Temperance upright brings healing, moderation, and inner peace. You are already learning the art of equilibrium. The question is — can you continue this without needing to be perfect?"

The Traveler: "I feel a little more hopeful. The drawn card is 'XVII - The Star (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The Star upright lights your path with renewal, calm, and deep spiritual guidance. That spark you feel is real — it’s the reminder that you haven’t been forgotten by the universe. Let it guide you, even when the way is faint."

The Traveler: "It feels like the light is finally returning. The drawn card is 'XIX - The Sun (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The Sun upright radiates clarity, joy, and abundance. You are emerging from shadow — and you are allowed to feel warmth again. What would it mean to let yourself fully receive it?"

The Traveler: "This is my final question. How do I keep growing strong without closing my heart? The drawn card is 'VIII - Strength (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "Strength upright closes your reading with quiet power and steady resolve. You are not fragile — you are growing. True resilience comes not from pushing through, but from soft endurance and self-trust. You are already more than enough."
