The mystical llama: "What is your concern?"  
The Traveler: "My instincts feel strong lately, like I’m sensing something before it happens. The drawn card is 'II - The High Priestess (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The upright High Priestess speaks through silence and signs — she doesn’t shout, she waits to be heard. What is she whispering beneath your distractions?"

The Traveler: "But I think I’m holding onto something that’s already ended. The drawn card is 'XIII - Death (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Death resists transformation — when clinging becomes a comfort. What might begin if you finally allowed it to end?"

The Traveler: "I’ve felt frozen lately, like I can’t act no matter how much I want to. The drawn card is 'XII - The Hanged Man (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Hanged Man is stuck, not still — waiting without release. What belief is keeping you suspended?"

The Traveler: "This is my final question. What am I really escaping from? The drawn card is 'XV - The Devil (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Devil reveals illusions crumbling — the chains were never locked. What freedom are you finally willing to claim?"
