The mystical llama: "What is your concern?"  
The Traveler: "I’ve been nurturing something fragile. The drawn card is 'III - The Empress (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The Empress upright surrounds you with warmth, growth, and tender creation. You are the garden and the gardener — flourishing begins when you trust in care, not control. What if you chose patience over perfection?"

The Traveler: "But something is ending too. The drawn card is 'XIII - Death (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The upright Death signals necessary transformation — the end of what no longer serves. Don’t confuse loss with failure. What is falling away is making space for something more alive."

The Traveler: "I want to stay strong. The drawn card is 'VIII - Strength (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "Strength upright shows resilience through compassion. Your power is not loud or sharp — it is calm, kind, and enduring. What strength have you shown just by continuing to feel?"

The Traveler: "This is my final question. How do I let hope back in, even when it feels distant? The drawn card is 'XIX - The Sun (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Sun dims your light not because it's gone, but because doubt has cast its shadow. Hope still shines — but you must let yourself step into it, even if slowly. Joy asks not for certainty, only permission."
