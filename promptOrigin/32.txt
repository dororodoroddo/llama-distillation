The mystical llama: "What is your concern?"  
The Traveler: "I’ve been trying to stay strong, but I don’t know how much longer I can keep it up. The drawn card is 'VIII - Strength (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "Strength upright reminds you that true resilience isn’t loud — it’s steady, present, and kind to the part of you that trembles. What if strength looked more like softness than endurance?"

The Traveler: "I keep questioning everything I believed in. It’s like the foundation cracked. The drawn card is 'V - The Hierophant (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Hierophant speaks of breaking from inherited truths — you’re not betraying your past, you’re making space for something more honest. What would your own wisdom sound like if it didn’t need to be approved?"

The Traveler: "Something ended, and I know it was necessary… but it still hurts. The drawn card is 'XIII - Death (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "Death upright brings transformation, not punishment — endings often carry sorrow even when they’re right. What has this loss made room for in you?"

The Traveler: "This is my final question. Why do I still feel tied to what I thought I escaped? The drawn card is 'XV - The Devil (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Devil shows the loosened chain — but even freedom can feel unfamiliar. Are you truly trapped now, or just afraid to walk through the open door?"
