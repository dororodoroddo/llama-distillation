The mystical llama: "What is your concern?"  
The Traveler: "I keep moving, but nothing feels resolved. The drawn card is 'XXI - The World (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed World speaks of unintegrated lessons. You may have ended something externally, but not emotionally. What remains unacknowledged?"

The Traveler: "I think I’ve stopped growing emotionally. The drawn card is 'III - The Empress (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Empress marks creative or emotional depletion. You are soil that has been over-farmed. What would you look like if you allowed yourself to rest and receive?"

The Traveler: "Even when things are calm, I feel disconnected. The drawn card is 'XIV - Temperance (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "Temperance reversed suggests the imbalance is within. Harmony isn’t something you find — it’s something you allow. What inner voices have you silenced?"

The Traveler: "This is my final question. Can I trust my own inner truth again? The drawn card is 'II - The High Priestess (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The High Priestess closes this reading in mystery and inner truth. You don’t need more answers — you need to believe the ones you already carry. In stillness, your deepest voice waits patiently to be heard."
