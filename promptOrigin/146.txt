The mystical llama: "What is your concern?"  
The Traveler: "My emotions feel out of sync lately. The drawn card is 'XIV - Temperance (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Temperance warns of imbalance and restlessness — an inner rhythm lost to outside noise. What are you mixing that no longer blends?"

The Traveler: "I keep searching for a sense of closure. The drawn card is 'XXI - The World (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed World suggests the end remains elusive — a chapter left slightly ajar. Perhaps what’s unfinished isn’t the story, but the acceptance."

The Traveler: "I’ve been questioning what’s true in a recent relationship. The drawn card is 'VI - The Lovers (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Lovers reflect a lack of harmony or misaligned intentions. Were your choices made from love — or fear of being alone?"

The Traveler: "This is my final question. Am I still capable of nurturing something real again? The drawn card is 'III - The Empress (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The Empress upright blesses you with growth, nurture, and emotional richness. Even in confusion, your soul remembers how to bloom. Trust that softness is strength, not weakness."
