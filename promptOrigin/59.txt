The mystical llama: "What is your concern?"  
The Traveler: "Something has clearly ended in my life, but I’m not sure what’s meant to replace it. The drawn card is 'XIII - Death (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The upright Death closes chapters with sacred finality — but not without reason. What has life cleared away to make space for something truer?"

The Traveler: "I thought things were about to change for the better, but now I’m uncertain. The drawn card is 'X - The Wheel of Fortune (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The upright Wheel offers change — but it asks you to turn with it, not against it. What outcome are you still trying to control?"

The Traveler: "In love, things have become tense and unclear. The drawn card is 'VI - The Lovers (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Lovers speak of disconnection — not necessarily absence, but imbalance. What needs to be said that’s been silenced for too long?"

The Traveler: "This is my final question. Why does everything feel like it’s covered in fog? The drawn card is 'XVIII - The Moon (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The upright Moon casts emotion in shadow — it asks you to feel, not analyze. What might you see if you stopped trying to figure it all out?"
