The mystical llama: "What is your concern?"  
The Traveler: "I’m searching for harmony, but life keeps pulling me off center. The drawn card is 'XIV - Temperance (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "Temperance upright blends opposites — a dance of grace, not perfection. What is asking for balance, not control?"

The Traveler: "A new beginning is possible, but I’m scared to leap. The drawn card is '0 - The Fool (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The upright Fool holds innocence and courage — a risk taken with trust. What if the unknown is exactly where your spirit belongs?"

The Traveler: "But every time I move forward, I stumble. The drawn card is 'VII - The Chariot (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Chariot lacks unified direction — movement without clarity. What are you running toward, and is it truly yours?"

The Traveler: "This is my final question. Will I ever feel steady in myself again? The drawn card is 'IV - The Emperor (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Emperor asks you to redefine strength — not as control, but as self-alignment. What would it take to feel safe in your own guidance?"
