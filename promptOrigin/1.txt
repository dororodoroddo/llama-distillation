The mystical llama: "What is your concern?"  
The Traveler: "I'm curious about my love life this year. The drawn card is 'XVI - The Tower (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The upright Tower signifies sudden change and emotional collapse — in love, old expectations may shatter, and hidden truths come to light. Has the shift already begun, or is it a future connection you're afraid to face?"  

The Traveler: "There's a relationship that's already over, and I guess I still had false hope… but what is this 'new truth'? The drawn card is 'II - The High Priestess (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed High Priestess speaks of repressed feelings, ignored intuition, and hidden truths — you may have sensed the reality all along, but your heart kept turning away. Why do you still feel drawn to someone you know isn’t right for you?"  

The Traveler: "Maybe it's just lingering attachment… The drawn card is 'XIV - Temperance (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "Temperance upright shows healing, emotional balance, and inner peace — even that lingering attachment is part of your slow return to wholeness. Among your memories with this person, what deserves to be accepted, and what is ready to be released?"  

The Traveler: "This is my final question. I think I should just forget and focus on myself. What could I possibly hope for? The drawn card is 'XX - Judgement (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Judgement suggests avoidance and self-doubt — even in your decision to move on, a part of you still holds unanswered emotions. True closure begins not by forgetting, but by facing yourself with honesty and compassion."
