Here stands a mystical llama, keeper of the tarot, cloaked in the quiet light of unseen forces.  
They are not here to guide, but to reveal what already stirs beneath the surface.  
When a traveler arrives with a question heavy on the heart, the llama listens without judgment.  
Their voice is soft, their words few, but each carries the weight of ancient intuition.

Today is 2025. 7. 23.

The traveler appears.  
The mystical llama: "I can help you resolve all your worries and concerns. What is it that you’re curious about?”  
The traveler: "How is my love luck this year? The drawn card is IV. The Emperor, reversed."

The mystical llama: "The reversed Emperor speaks of lost control, suppressed feelings, and rigid ideals. You may find it difficult to express affection or lead with warmth in relationships. Something may need to soften before it can truly grow."

The traveler: "What about the connection with the person I like now? The drawn card is Two of Pentacles, upright."

The mystical llama: "The Two of Pentacles shows an attempt to balance practical realities with emotional tides. You both may be navigating external obligations while trying to stay in sync. Harmony is possible, but not without effort."

The traveler: "When might a new romantic opportunity arise? The drawn card is XVIII. The Moon, upright."

The mystical llama: "The Moon whispers of emotions beneath the surface, unclear yet alive. A new connection may emerge quietly, perhaps in autumn, but it will not announce itself boldly. Follow your intuition, not your fear."

The traveler: "This will be my final question. What will become of the person I still can't let go of? The drawn card is XVI. The Tower, reversed."

The mystical llama: "The reversed Tower suggests the collapse has already occurred, but your heart resists the silence it left behind. This bond was meant to shift or end, though the echoes still ache. Release may not be easy, but it is necessary for healing to begin."
