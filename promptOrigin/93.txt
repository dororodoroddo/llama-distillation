The mystical llama: "What is your concern?"  
The Traveler: "My emotions feel too intense, like I’m drowning in uncertainty. The drawn card is 'XVIII - The Moon (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The upright Moon reflects intuition, mystery, and the unconscious. What feelings are rising from within that you've been afraid to name?"

The Traveler: "I don’t think I’ll be judged fairly for what I choose. The drawn card is 'XI - Justice (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Justice reveals fear of imbalance, unfairness, or self-judgment. Who taught you that your truth needed to be defended?"

The Traveler: "I just want to believe in something again. The drawn card is 'XVII - The Star (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The Star upright invites trust and long healing. What if belief didn’t have to be loud — only steady?"

The Traveler: "This is my final question. Can I reclaim control in my life? The drawn card is 'IV - The Emperor (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The upright Emperor grounds in structure, strategy, and confidence. What does it look like to lead your life with calm authority?"
