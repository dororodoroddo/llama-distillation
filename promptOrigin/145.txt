The mystical llama: "What is your concern?"  
The Traveler: "I’ve been stuck in guilt and inaction. The drawn card is 'XI - Justice (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Justice shows inner imbalance or fear of truth. Blame is not clarity. What if accountability could be freeing, not punishing?"

The Traveler: "There’s something I can’t release. The drawn card is 'XIII - Death (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Death holds space for the thing you’ve not let go. But clinging won’t preserve it — it only delays peace. What ritual of release might honor it, and you?"

The Traveler: "I’m not sure I can nurture others anymore. The drawn card is 'III - The Empress (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Empress speaks of depletion. You’ve poured too much from an empty cup. What would rest look like if it wasn’t shameful?"

The Traveler: "This is my final question. How do I return from all this retreat and begin again? The drawn card is 'IX - The Hermit (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Hermit ends your journey with a mirror — not of solitude, but escape. You’ve lingered long in retreat. Step back into the world, not for noise, but for connection. Your lantern still shines — let it lead you forward."
