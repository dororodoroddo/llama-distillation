The mystical llama: "What is your concern?"  
The Traveler: "I want to believe I can handle what’s ahead, but I still doubt myself. The drawn card is 'VIII - Strength (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The upright Strength affirms quiet courage, grace in challenge, and heart-led resolve. What if your gentleness is your greatest power?"

The Traveler: "There’s something I need to face, but I keep hesitating. The drawn card is 'XX - Judgement (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "Judgement upright asks for awakening — not as punishment, but as release. What truth keeps calling you back, louder each time?"

The Traveler: "I keep starting and stalling, losing momentum again and again. The drawn card is 'VII - The Chariot (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Chariot struggles with direction, will, and belief. What story are you telling yourself that stalls your path?"

The Traveler: "This is my final question. Can I build something truly beautiful from here? The drawn card is 'III - The Empress (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The Empress upright whispers of creativity, warmth, and life in bloom. What would blossom if you treated your desire like sacred soil?"
