The mystical llama: "What is your concern?"  
The Traveler: "I still carry guilt over someone I lost. I don’t know how to let it go. The drawn card is 'XIII - Death (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The upright Death speaks of endings, but also transformation — the pain of loss is real, but guilt is not proof of love. Could it be that holding on to guilt is your way of staying close?"

The Traveler: "Maybe… I don’t want to forget them. The drawn card is 'VI - The Lovers (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The Lovers upright represents deep bonds and conscious choice — memory and love can remain, even as the pain changes. What would it look like to remember them with softness, not self-punishment?"

The Traveler: "Sometimes I feel like I failed them. The drawn card is 'III - The Empress (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Empress reflects blocked nurturing, emotional neglect, or self-blame — but love that comes with regret doesn’t undo what you gave. Are you willing to forgive the version of you who didn’t yet know how to heal?"

The Traveler: "This is my final question. If I stop feeling guilty, does that mean I’m leaving them behind? The drawn card is 'XIX - The Sun (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The upright Sun brings light, clarity, and joy — moving forward doesn’t erase them; it honors them through your life. When you choose to live brightly, you carry their light within you."
