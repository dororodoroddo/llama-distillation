The mystical llama: "What is your concern?"  
The Traveler: "I feel like fate is against me. The drawn card is 'X - The Wheel of Fortune (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Wheel of Fortune suggests disruption, delays, or resistance to the flow. But fate is not your enemy — only your reflection. What pattern keeps returning, asking to be seen?"

The Traveler: "I thought something was complete, but it isn’t. The drawn card is 'XXI - The World (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed World signals unfinished business — a lesson left open, a chapter not fully closed. Completion is coming, but it needs one final act of acknowledgment. What haven’t you truly released yet?"

The Traveler: "I want to regain direction. The drawn card is 'VII - The Chariot (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The Chariot upright brings movement through clarity and discipline. It is not about speed, but focus. What are you moving toward — and what must you let go of to get there?"

The Traveler: "This is my final question. What truth must I face to move forward cleanly? The drawn card is 'XI - Justice (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "Justice upright brings truth, fairness, and inner reckoning. You are being asked to see clearly — not just others, but yourself. The scales balance not through vengeance, but through courage to look inward."
