The mystical llama: "What is your concern?"  
The Traveler: "I feel like I’ve completed a chapter. The drawn card is 'XXI - The World (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The upright World celebrates achievement, wholeness, and the closing of a sacred cycle. You've reached a rare clarity — a place where lessons integrate into wisdom. What does it mean to honor not just the journey, but the version of you who walked it?"

The Traveler: "I’ve let go of some toxic ties. The drawn card is 'XV - The Devil (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Devil reveals a break from bondage, a step toward liberation. But release takes time. Have you truly loosened the emotional grip, or are you still haunted by its shape?"

The Traveler: "Now I just want to hope again. The drawn card is 'XVII - The Star (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The upright Star shines as a guide toward healing and renewal. You're reaching toward light after darkness. Let that hope soften your scars — it's not naive to believe again, it's brave."

The Traveler: "This is my final question. How do I begin again without fear? The drawn card is '0 - The Fool (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The Fool upright brings a beautiful invitation — to begin again with wonder. You are standing at the edge of a new story, and though the ground is unfamiliar, your spirit is ready. Step forward. There is wisdom in your openness."
