The mystical llama: "What is your concern?"  
The Traveler: "I’m beginning something new, but I feel unsure of myself. The drawn card is 'I - The Magician (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The upright Magician affirms your potential — you hold the tools, but intention must guide your action. What purpose will shape your first step?"

The Traveler: "There’s a part of me that keeps second-guessing. The drawn card is 'II - The High Priestess (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed High Priestess clouds your intuition with self-doubt. What inner voice have you been ignoring — and why?"

The Traveler: "Despite all this, something in me is waking up. The drawn card is 'XX - Judgement (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "Judgement upright brings renewal through honest reflection. What past part of yourself is ready to be laid to rest — and what is rising in its place?"

The Traveler: "This is my final question. Can I trust the timing of it all? The drawn card is 'X - The Wheel of Fortune (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The upright Wheel moves with divine rhythm — your task is to meet change with grace. What could unfold if you stopped trying to control the turn?"
