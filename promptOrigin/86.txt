The mystical llama: "What is your concern?"  
The Traveler: "I don’t feel in control of my life lately. Everything seems out of balance. The drawn card is 'IV - The Emperor (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Emperor reflects loss of stability, overcompensation, or rigid detachment. What control are you trying to reclaim — and is it truly yours to hold?"

The Traveler: "I’ve been trying to make fair choices, but nothing feels just. The drawn card is 'XI - Justice (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "Justice upright calls for clarity and responsibility — not only toward others, but toward yourself. What truth are you hesitating to admit?"

The Traveler: "I think I’ve neglected myself too much in the process. The drawn card is 'III - The Empress (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Empress shows depletion, blocked nurturing, or emotional silence. What part of you is asking to be held with care?"

The Traveler: "This is my final question. Am I strong enough to shift this? The drawn card is 'VIII - Strength (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Strength doubts its own heart — but strength isn’t perfection. What would it mean to be brave enough to rest?"
