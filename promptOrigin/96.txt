The mystical llama: "What is your concern?"  
The Traveler: "Something big almost ended recently, but I feel like I’m still clinging. The drawn card is 'XVI - The Tower (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Tower signals a delayed collapse or a fear of letting go. What would fall away if you surrendered to transformation?"

The Traveler: "I’ve been turning inward a lot lately. The drawn card is 'II - The High Priestess (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The High Priestess upright invites silence, insight, and sacred stillness. What inner knowing is quietly waiting for your attention?"

The Traveler: "I feel stuck, like I’m suspended midair. The drawn card is 'XII - The Hanged Man (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The Hanged Man upright offers perspective through pause. What new truth might appear if you release your need to act?"

The Traveler: "This is my final question. Will I ever break free from what’s holding me? The drawn card is 'XV - The Devil (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Devil offers liberation — but not without awareness. What false attachment are you willing to name, then walk away from?"
