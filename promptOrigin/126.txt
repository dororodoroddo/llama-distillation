The mystical llama: "What is your concern?"  
The Traveler: "I’ve been trying to rebuild order in my life. The drawn card is 'IV - The Emperor (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The Emperor upright brings structure, authority, and grounded leadership. You’re establishing strong foundations — but beware turning discipline into rigidity. What does healthy order look like when it makes room for breath?"

The Traveler: "But I still feel uncertain. The drawn card is 'XVIII - The Moon (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The Moon upright draws you into the realm of dreams, illusions, and shifting truths. Uncertainty doesn’t mean failure — it’s part of transformation. What can you learn when you stop demanding certainty?"

The Traveler: "I keep thinking about past decisions. The drawn card is 'XX - Judgement (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Judgement reflects resistance to awakening or clarity. You may be haunted by your past not because it defines you — but because you're ready to move beyond it. What story are you willing to let go of?"

The Traveler: "This is my final question. What must I accept in order to move through this quietly collapsing chapter? The drawn card is 'XVI - The Tower (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Tower warns of a crumbling that’s being delayed — a storm you see coming but still try to avoid. Change is arriving whether you welcome it or not. Soften the impact by meeting it willingly, before it breaks through the walls you’ve clung to."
