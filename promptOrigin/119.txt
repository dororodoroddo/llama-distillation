The mystical llama: "What is your concern?"  
The Traveler: "I feel like I’ve missed a calling. The drawn card is 'XX - Judgement (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Judgement speaks to hesitation and self-doubt — a refusal to step into transformation. You may fear you're too late, but the truth is, the call never truly fades. Will you answer it now, even quietly?"

The Traveler: "I want to act, but I don’t know if it’s right. The drawn card is 'I - The Magician (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The upright Magician empowers you with the tools of creation. You can shape your path — but your intention must be clean. Are you building from ego, or from alignment?"

The Traveler: "I want clarity, not confusion. The drawn card is 'XIX - The Sun (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The upright Sun brings truth, warmth, and joyful illumination. What once felt clouded now begins to glow with purpose. Can you trust that your light won’t fade if you share it?"

The Traveler: "This is my final question. How do I begin again when I’m afraid of being naive? The drawn card is '0 - The Fool (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The upright Fool invites you to begin again — not from ignorance, but from innocence. You’ve carried the weight of old stories. Now you’re free to leap, unburdened. Say yes to the journey, and let the next chapter surprise you."
