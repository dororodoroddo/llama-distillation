The mystical llama: "What is your concern?"  
The Traveler: "Hope feels far away. The drawn card is 'XVII - The Star (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Star dims your sense of renewal — yet the light has not gone out. Even faint hope is still hope. What would happen if you believed things could shift, even a little?"

The Traveler: "I feel stuck in a moment I can’t move past. The drawn card is 'XII - The Hanged Man (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The Hanged Man upright invites surrender — not as giving up, but giving in to understanding. You’re here for a reason. Let this pause become sacred, not stagnant."

The Traveler: "I’m afraid I’ve missed my calling. The drawn card is 'XX - Judgement (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Judgement suggests a fear of missing your moment. But awakening can happen again, and again. What if your time is not behind you, but quietly forming?"

The Traveler: "This is my final question. How do I release what’s holding me frozen? The drawn card is 'XII - The Hanged Man (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Hanged Man warns that your pause has become paralysis. You know something must shift — but fear makes you clutch the familiar. Release doesn't mean defeat. It may be your beginning."
