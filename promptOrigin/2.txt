The mystical llama: "What is your concern?"  
The Traveler: "I'm wondering about my career path. The drawn card is 'VII - The Chariot (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The upright Chariot symbolizes determination, willpower, and forward momentum — your career may be ready to surge ahead if you hold focus and don’t hesitate. Are you driving toward something clear, or simply pushing forward without a destination?"  

The Traveler: "I do have goals, but I’m not sure if I’m doing it for myself or just to prove something. The drawn card is 'XV - The Devil (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Devil speaks of releasing unhealthy attachments or illusions — perhaps you're beginning to free yourself from motivations rooted in fear or validation. What would your ambition look like if it came purely from your inner calling?"  

The Traveler: "Then... am I on the right path at all? The drawn card is 'IX - The Hermit (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The Hermit represents introspection, wisdom, and solitude — this phase may not be about external results but finding inner clarity. What lessons are quietly shaping you in this pause between the noise?"  

The Traveler: "This is my final question. If I stop trying to prove something, will I lose all momentum? The drawn card is 'X - The Wheel of Fortune (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Wheel of Fortune points to resistance to change and fear of losing control — but even detours hold purpose. Letting go of control doesn’t halt your path; it may simply bring you to a different, truer one."
