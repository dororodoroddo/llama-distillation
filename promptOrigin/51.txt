The mystical llama: "What is your concern?"  
The Traveler: "I keep hearing this inner call for change, but I’m afraid to act on it. The drawn card is 'XX - Judgement (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Judgement reflects hesitation to awaken — when truth whispers but you pretend not to hear. What are you delaying because it might change everything?"

The Traveler: "My life feels stuck, like the same things keep happening no matter what I do. The drawn card is 'X - The Wheel of Fortune (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Wheel shows blocked movement — cycles repeating until the lesson is learned. What are you clinging to that’s keeping the wheel from turning?"

The Traveler: "I’ve been questioning all the rules I once followed. The drawn card is 'V - The Hierophant (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Hierophant invites you to write your own truths. What tradition are you keeping out of habit, not belief?"

The Traveler: "This is my final question. Am I ready to fully leave the past behind? The drawn card is 'XIII - Death (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The upright Death welcomes transformation — not an end, but a sacred shift. What part of your story is ready to close so a new one can begin?"
