The mystical llama: "What is your concern?"  
The Traveler: "I’m afraid I won’t be treated fairly in what comes next. The drawn card is 'XI - Justice (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Justice points to imbalance — within or around you. What would shift if fairness began with how you speak to yourself?"

The Traveler: "I’m trying to stay strong, but it’s getting harder. The drawn card is 'VIII - Strength (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The upright Strength isn’t about holding it all together — it’s about meeting struggle with grace. Where can you soften without giving up?"

The Traveler: "There’s something I can’t stop indulging in, even though I know it’s not good for me. The drawn card is 'XV - The Devil (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The upright Devil binds through illusion — you are not your craving. What would it feel like to name the chain, and then loosen it?"

The Traveler: "This is my final question. Will I ever truly change? The drawn card is 'XIII - Death (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Death hesitates before transformation. What are you still trying to keep alive that’s already asking to be released?"
