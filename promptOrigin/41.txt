The mystical llama: "What is your concern?"  
The Traveler: "I feel like everything I believed in is falling apart. The drawn card is 'V - The Hierophant (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Hierophant speaks of a break from tradition or a crisis of belief. When the familiar crumbles, your true values can finally emerge. What are you clinging to that no longer serves?"

The Traveler: "Every time I want to begin something new, I feel like I'm not ready. The drawn card is 'I - The Magician (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Magician reflects untapped potential or self-doubt. It’s not that you lack power — it’s that you’re unsure you can wield it. What would change if you trusted your tools?"

The Traveler: "I'm trying to stay balanced, but everything feels out of sync. The drawn card is 'XIV - Temperance (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "Reversed Temperance shows inner discord or neglected needs. When you stretch yourself too thin, something essential gets lost. What would it mean to prioritize your wholeness?"

The Traveler: "This is my final question. Why can’t I let go of what’s holding me back? The drawn card is 'XV - The Devil (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Devil reveals a chance to break free — but first you must name the chain. What are you still calling comfort, when it’s really confinement?"
