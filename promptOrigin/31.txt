The mystical llama: "What is your concern?"  
The Traveler: "I keep hesitating when I know it’s time to move on. The drawn card is 'XII - The Hanged Man (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Hanged Man reflects fear of release — you may say you’re stuck, but what are you still hoping to save? Not moving can feel like safety, but it often becomes stagnation."

The Traveler: "There’s something I can’t let go of — even though I know it’s hurting me. The drawn card is 'XV - The Devil (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "Reversed Devil signals the moment just before liberation — where the chain is loose, but still familiar. What would it take to choose discomfort over numbness, just long enough to break free?"

The Traveler: "I don’t feel cared for — not even by myself. The drawn card is 'III - The Empress (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Empress reveals emotional depletion — when nurturing flows outward endlessly, the roots dry up. What would it look like to offer tenderness to the part of you that feels undeserving?"

The Traveler: "This is my final question. How do I trust anything when everything feels like an illusion? The drawn card is 'XVIII - The Moon (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Moon invites you to question not what’s real, but what’s repeated — illusions lose power when named. Trust may not start in certainty, but in quiet, persistent clarity."
