The mystical llama: "What is your concern?"  
The Traveler: "I feel like I’m drifting away from my friends lately. The drawn card is 'VI - The Lovers (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Lovers suggests disharmony, emotional distance, or difficulty in making heartfelt choices — a bond may be strained not by conflict, but by growing silence. Is the space between you created by them, or by something you’re holding back?"

The Traveler: "Maybe I’ve been closing off without realizing. The drawn card is 'III - The Empress (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The Empress upright reflects nurturing energy and emotional openness — perhaps what you need isn’t distance, but to reconnect with softness and care. What would it feel like to show your vulnerability, even just a little?"

The Traveler: "I’m afraid it’ll be seen as weakness. The drawn card is 'VIII - Strength (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "Strength upright reveals courage, inner calm, and compassion — true strength is found not in walls, but in kindness under pressure. What would change if you trusted that your gentleness is also powerful?"

The Traveler: "This is my final question. What if I reach out and they don’t respond? The drawn card is 'V - The Hierophant (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The Hierophant symbolizes guidance, tradition, and connection through shared understanding — even if they don’t respond immediately, your sincerity may plant a quiet seed. In choosing to reach out, you honor what matters most: the bond itself."
