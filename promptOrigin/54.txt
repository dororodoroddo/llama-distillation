The mystical llama: "What is your concern?"  
The Traveler: "I feel cut off from my inner voice lately. The drawn card is 'II - The High Priestess (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed High Priestess suggests blocked intuition and spiritual noise. What’s clouding your ability to listen inward — fear or distraction?"

The Traveler: "But I still sense a little hope beneath all the confusion. The drawn card is 'XVII - The Star (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The Star upright is gentle light in darkness — hope, healing, renewal. What does this quiet hope want to grow into, if you protect it?"

The Traveler: "Still, I’m unsure of my place and feel like I lack direction. The drawn card is 'IV - The Emperor (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Emperor suggests unstable footing — leadership without clarity. What internal structure might help you feel rooted again?"

The Traveler: "This is my final question. Will my life finally begin to move again soon? The drawn card is 'X - The Wheel of Fortune (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The upright Wheel brings momentum and change — but not always comfort. Are you ready to embrace the new rhythm, even if it arrives without warning?"
