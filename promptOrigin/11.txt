The mystical llama: "What is your concern?"  
The Traveler: "I keep breaking down over the smallest things. I don’t feel strong at all. The drawn card is 'VIII - Strength (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "Reversed Strength reveals self-doubt, emotional fragility, and the pressure to appear composed — true strength doesn’t come from holding it all together, but from honoring what hurts. What part of you is still begging to be held, not hidden?"

The Traveler: "I feel like life keeps turning against me. No matter what I try, nothing shifts. The drawn card is 'X - The Wheel of Fortune (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Wheel warns of resistance to change and fear of surrender — the wheel turns whether you push it or not. Are you clinging to the illusion of control, while life gently asks you to release?"

The Traveler: "I think I’ve been avoiding taking care of myself. I just feel empty. The drawn card is 'III - The Empress (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Empress reflects neglect of the self, creative depletion, and unmet emotional needs — you’ve been pouring into everything but yourself. What would it mean to be your own source of nourishment?"

The Traveler: "This is my final question. If I let everything fall, will I still be okay? The drawn card is 'XVI - The Tower (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Tower suggests fear of collapse and clinging to what’s already broken — but survival is not the same as living. If you dared to let it fall, what truth might rise in its place?"
