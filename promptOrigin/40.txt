The mystical llama: "What is your concern?"  
The Traveler: "I know this habit is hurting me, but I can’t seem to break free. The drawn card is 'XV - The Devil (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The Devil upright shows you the chain — not to shame you, but to ask what you’re still choosing. What does this attachment offer that feels safer than freedom?"

The Traveler: "Something ended in my life, and I’m not sure who I am now. The drawn card is 'XIII - Death (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "Death upright is the sacred unraveling — who you were has made space for who you are becoming. What are you afraid to become now that the old shape no longer fits?"

The Traveler: "I want to start over, but I keep hesitating. The drawn card is '0 - The Fool (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Fool hesitates at the edge — not from lack of desire, but fear of falling. What if uncertainty is not a cliff, but the very path forward?"

The Traveler: "This is my final question. Will I ever feel safe being vulnerable again? The drawn card is 'III - The Empress (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The Empress upright reminds you that safety blooms from nurturing — especially your own. When you offer yourself softness without condition, you make room for tenderness to return."
