The mystical llama: "What is your concern?"  
The Traveler: "I’ve been choosing solitude, but I wonder if I’m hiding from something. The drawn card is 'IX - The Hermit (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The upright Hermit seeks wisdom in solitude — but wisdom only comes if you’re willing to look inward. What truth are you avoiding by calling it reflection?"

The Traveler: "Something big broke in me recently, but I can’t admit how bad it feels. The drawn card is 'XVI - The Tower (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Tower is silent collapse — stillness after a storm no one else saw. What pain are you carrying alone because it doesn’t look dramatic?"

The Traveler: "It keeps echoing — I keep replaying the moment. The drawn card is 'XVI - The Tower (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "When the Tower appears again, it asks for release — to stop rehearsing the ruins. What would it mean to let it be part of your past, not your present?"

The Traveler: "This is my final question. Will I ever feel strong again? The drawn card is 'IV - The Emperor (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Emperor feels powerless when control is lost — but true strength survives in the rubble. What does it look like to build yourself again, differently?"
