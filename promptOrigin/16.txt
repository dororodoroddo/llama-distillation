The mystical llama: "What is your concern?"  
The Traveler: "I want to make the right decision, but I’m scared of the consequences. The drawn card is 'XI - Justice (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "Justice upright speaks of truth, accountability, and moral clarity — the right choice is not the easiest one, but the one you can live with in silence. What does your inner scale weigh when no one else is watching?"

The Traveler: "I know what’s right, but something keeps pulling me back. The drawn card is 'XV - The Devil (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The upright Devil reveals attachment, fear, and patterns disguised as comfort — temptation isn’t always loud; sometimes it whispers in your own voice. What binds you that once felt like safety?"

The Traveler: "Maybe I just don’t trust myself to change. The drawn card is 'XX - Judgement (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "Reversed Judgement speaks of avoidance, self-doubt, and fear of awakening — forgiveness isn’t a reward for perfection, but a door you must choose to walk through. Are you punishing yourself for not being finished yet?"

The Traveler: "This is my final question. Can I take back control of my life? The drawn card is 'VII - The Chariot (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The upright Chariot reminds you of discipline, willpower, and aligned action — control isn’t force; it’s direction fueled by belief. Your life moves when you decide where to steer it."
