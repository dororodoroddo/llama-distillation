The mystical llama: "What is your concern?"  
The Traveler: "I’ve begun to feel a faint light inside again. The drawn card is 'XVII - The Star (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The upright Star is a quiet promise — healing, inspiration, and gentle renewal. What are you ready to believe in again?"

The Traveler: "But I still don’t fully understand what my heart is trying to say. The drawn card is 'II - The High Priestess (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The High Priestess invites you to listen beyond words — to feel what’s true without needing to explain it. What would your intuition say if you trusted it completely?"

The Traveler: "My life feels like it keeps repeating patterns. I want change, but it slips away. The drawn card is 'X - The Wheel of Fortune (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Wheel of Fortune reflects cycles stuck in resistance — growth delayed, but not denied. What are you still trying to control that must be surrendered?"

The Traveler: "This is my final question. Why can’t I seem to fully feel joy, even when I know I should? The drawn card is 'XIX - The Sun (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Sun shines behind a veil — the light is there, but shadows remain. What if joy isn’t about proving happiness, but allowing even the smallest warmth to stay?"
