The mystical llama: "What is your concern?"  
The Traveler: "My emotions are blocked, and I feel numb. The drawn card is 'III - The Empress (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Empress speaks of withered care, unmet needs, or suppressed love. Your garden is thirsty. What kindness can you offer yourself first?"

The Traveler: "I’ve pulled away from everything. The drawn card is 'IX - The Hermit (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "Again, the reversed Hermit urges reconnection. Withdrawal has served its purpose. Now, it may be time to return. What waits for you just outside the cave?"

The Traveler: "I keep wondering what’s unfinished. The drawn card is 'XXI - The World (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "Something important is incomplete — a truth unclaimed, a goodbye unsaid. Your wholeness needs no audience. What completion are you still waiting to give yourself?"

The Traveler: "This is my final question. Should I keep following what I was taught, or find a different path? The drawn card is 'V - The Hierophant (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The Hierophant upright offers guidance through tradition, wisdom, or spiritual roots. There is strength in legacy, but not all of it must be obeyed. Seek what truly nourishes your soul — and release what no longer fits."
