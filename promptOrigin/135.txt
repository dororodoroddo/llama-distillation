The mystical llama: "What is your concern?"  
The Traveler: "I keep waiting for the right time. The drawn card is 'XII - The Hanged Man (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Hanged Man speaks of resistance to surrender — a refusal to pause. But delay can turn into denial. What insight might come if you chose stillness, not as a trap, but as a gift?"

The Traveler: "Something broke, but I’m still holding it. The drawn card is 'XVI - The Tower (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Tower suggests avoidance of a necessary collapse. The structure is already cracked — pretending it's whole won’t make it so. What are you afraid will happen if you finally let it fall?"

The Traveler: "I’m scared to begin again. The drawn card is '0 - The Fool (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Fool holds hesitation and fear of the unknown. You're at the edge, looking down — but the fall may be flight. What if your next chapter begins with one trembling yes?"

The Traveler: "This is my final question. How do I let light return after everything that’s fallen? The drawn card is 'XIX - The Sun (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Sun dims the light with doubt or weariness. But joy is still possible — not through pretending everything is fine, but by letting yourself feel warmth again, little by little. The morning will come. Let yourself believe it."
