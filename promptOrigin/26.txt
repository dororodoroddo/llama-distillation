The mystical llama: "What is your concern?"  
The Traveler: "I made a decision that still haunts me. I don’t know if I did the right thing. The drawn card is 'XI - Justice (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Justice speaks of moral uncertainty and self-judgment — perhaps the guilt lives not in the choice itself, but in how you’ve carried it since. What would it mean to forgive the part of you that did the best it could?"

The Traveler: "I keep trying to take action and rebuild something, but I don’t know where to begin. The drawn card is 'I - The Magician (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The Magician upright reminds you that potential doesn’t wait for confidence — it waits for consent. You already have everything you need. What could you create if you stopped doubting your own hands?"

The Traveler: "I think I still want something that no longer wants me back. The drawn card is 'VI - The Lovers (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The Lovers upright asks for conscious alignment — not just desire, but choice. Are you loving someone, or loving the idea of being chosen?"

The Traveler: "This is my final question. Why can’t I just let go? The drawn card is 'XII - The Hanged Man (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Hanged Man reveals resistance to release — not because you can't, but because you fear what stillness will reveal. What if letting go is the only way to hear what comes next?"
