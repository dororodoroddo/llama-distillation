The mystical llama: "What is your concern?"  
The Traveler: "I feel disconnected from the values I once held. The drawn card is 'V - The Hierophant (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Hierophant invites personal belief over tradition — a new truth. What voice inside you feels sacred, even if it doesn’t match the rules?"

The Traveler: "But I’ve also felt unusually intuitive lately. The drawn card is 'II - The High Priestess (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The High Priestess upright is a gatekeeper of silent knowing — she speaks without words. What are you sensing that logic can’t yet explain?"

The Traveler: "Yet I still doubt my ability to act on these insights. The drawn card is 'I - The Magician (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Magician lacks confidence, not power — the tools are there, but unused. What part of you doesn’t believe you’re ready?"

The Traveler: "This is my final question. Can I trust the changes I feel are coming? The drawn card is 'X - The Wheel of Fortune (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Wheel may shake the ground to move you — uncertainty is its language. What if trust begins not with clarity, but with courage?"
