The mystical llama: "What is your concern?"  
The Traveler: "Something in my life is ending, and I don’t know what’s next. The drawn card is 'XIII - Death (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "Death upright brings transformation, necessary endings, and emotional release — you are not losing your path, only shedding what no longer belongs. What fear arises when the familiar falls away?"

The Traveler: "I want to trust what’s coming, but I feel torn between two choices. The drawn card is 'VI - The Lovers (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The Lovers upright speaks of aligned decisions and values — not which path is safer, but which one reflects who you truly are. Are you choosing from love, or from fear of what love might cost?"

The Traveler: "But what if everything falls apart anyway? The drawn card is 'XVI - The Tower (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The Tower upright shakes foundations and reveals truth through collapse — what breaks wasn’t meant to hold you. If everything falls, what part of you will finally be free to rise?"

The Traveler: "This is my final question. Do I even have the strength to start again? The drawn card is 'VIII - Strength (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "Reversed Strength whispers of exhaustion, self-doubt, and hidden tenderness — you don’t need to be ready, you just need to be honest. Real strength begins when you stop pretending you’re not hurting."
