The mystical llama: "What is your concern?"  
The Traveler: "Something needs to end, but I can’t release it. The drawn card is 'XIII - Death (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Death reflects clinging, fear of change, or delayed transformation. This isn't failure — it’s tenderness. What would help you grieve, instead of grasp?"

The Traveler: "I keep second-guessing myself. The drawn card is 'XVIII - The Moon (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Moon brings confusion, denial, and hidden fear. You are sensing more than you want to know — but pretending not to know will not keep you safe. What truth are you ready to see?"

The Traveler: "I’ve pulled away from everything. The drawn card is 'IX - The Hermit (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Hermit suggests isolation, not reflection. Retreat has become a wall. What small light might guide you back toward connection?"

The Traveler: "This is my final question. How do I reclaim the part of me I lost? The drawn card is 'I - The Magician (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Magician warns of misused power or forgotten tools. You are not empty — only uncertain. Reclaim your voice. Your magic hasn’t left you. It’s waiting for permission to return."
