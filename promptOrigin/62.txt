The mystical llama: "What is your concern?"  
The Traveler: "Lately I can’t tell what’s real or imagined in my emotions. The drawn card is 'XVIII - The Moon (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The Moon upright blurs edges between intuition and illusion — not to confuse, but to deepen. What part of you is asking to be felt before it can be understood?"

The Traveler: "I know something has ended… but I still don’t know how to move on. The drawn card is 'XIII - Death (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "Death upright is a sacred close, not a loss of meaning — but grief doesn’t follow rules. What space has this ending opened, even if it still aches?"

The Traveler: "When I try to rebuild, I feel unsure of my own decisions. The drawn card is 'IV - The Emperor (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Emperor questions authority — not to erase it, but to reframe it. What version of leadership do you need to offer yourself now?"

The Traveler: "This is my final question. What can solitude teach me that others can’t? The drawn card is 'IX - The Hermit (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The Hermit upright lights the inner cave — he doesn’t escape, he listens. What truth rises in silence when no one else is watching?"
