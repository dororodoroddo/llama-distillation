The mystical llama: "What is your concern?"  
The Traveler: "I’ve been trying to find peace, but I feel like I’m always stretched thin. The drawn card is 'XIV - Temperance (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "Temperance upright offers healing through gentle integration — not by fixing everything, but by holding space for what is. What would happen if you stopped rushing to be okay?"

The Traveler: "I've followed the path others told me to. Why do I still feel so lost? The drawn card is 'V - The Hierophant (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The Hierophant speaks of structure, tradition, and external guidance — but sometimes the voice of wisdom sounds different inside. Whose truth have you been living?"

The Traveler: "I keep searching for joy, but it always feels just out of reach. The drawn card is 'XIX - The Sun (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Sun suggests joy is dimmed, not gone — perhaps clouded by old expectations. What if happiness isn’t loud or bright, but quiet and waiting in the background?"

The Traveler: "This is my final question. What should I listen to now? The drawn card is 'II - The High Priestess (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The High Priestess invites you into deep intuition — a knowing that doesn’t shout, but hums. In stillness, what truth has been whispering all along?"
