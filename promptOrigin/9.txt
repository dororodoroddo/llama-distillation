The mystical llama: "What is your concern?"  
The Traveler: "I'm standing at a major crossroads in life, and I’m afraid to make the wrong choice. The drawn card is 'VI - The Lovers (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The Lovers upright speaks not just of romance, but of alignment and conscious decisions — this is not about right or wrong, but about what’s true. Whose voice are you really trying to satisfy?"

The Traveler: "Maybe not mine… I’ve been living by what others expect. The drawn card is 'XV - The Devil (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The upright Devil reveals attachment, control, and false security — perhaps the fear of disappointing others has become a chain around your will. If you stopped needing permission, what choice would feel like freedom?"

The Traveler: "But what if I lose everything I’ve worked for? The drawn card is 'XVI - The Tower (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The Tower upright signals necessary destruction — what crumbles wasn’t meant to hold you. Are you preserving a structure that no longer shelters your truth?"

The Traveler: "This is my final question. Can I really live a life that’s mine alone? The drawn card is '0 - The Fool (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The Fool upright is not foolishness, but sacred risk — your own life begins where others' expectations end. When you step with trust into the unknown, the path becomes yours simply because you chose it."
