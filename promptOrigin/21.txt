The mystical llama: "What is your concern?"  
The Traveler: "I want to take a leap, but every time I try, something stops me. The drawn card is '0 - The Fool (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "Reversed Fool whispers of a threshold unmet — your feet are ready, but your trust is still behind you. What would it feel like to leap without demanding certainty?"

The Traveler: "I’m afraid everything will fall apart if I do. The drawn card is 'XVI - The Tower (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Tower warns of holding up what’s already broken — collapse resisted becomes suffering prolonged. What are you afraid to let fall, even if it’s already crumbling?"

The Traveler: "But part of me still wants to believe something better is waiting. The drawn card is 'XIX - The Sun (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The Sun upright speaks of joy that endures, even when buried under doubt — your light isn’t gone, only covered. What might bloom if you gave it permission to shine again?"

The Traveler: "This is my final question. Will I have the strength to change? The drawn card is 'VIII - Strength (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "Strength reminds you that transformation is not loud — it is quiet, slow, and kind. Your power lies not in conquering fear, but in walking alongside it with grace."
