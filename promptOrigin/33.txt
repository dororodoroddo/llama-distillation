The mystical llama: "What is your concern?"  
The Traveler: "No matter how hard I try, I can’t seem to move forward. The drawn card is 'VII - The Chariot (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Chariot reveals misaligned motion — maybe you’re pushing in a direction your soul doesn’t want to go. What would change if you stopped moving long enough to listen?"

The Traveler: "I feel disconnected from myself — like I can’t hear what’s true anymore. The drawn card is 'II - The High Priestess (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed High Priestess speaks of a voice ignored, not absent — your intuition hasn’t gone quiet, it’s just been drowned by doubt. Can you sit still enough to hear what’s been waiting for you?"

The Traveler: "There’s someone I care about… but I’m scared to choose them. The drawn card is 'VI - The Lovers (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The Lovers upright reflects sacred choice — not just about romance, but alignment. If love asked you to be fully seen, could you let it?"

The Traveler: "This is my final question. What if I risk it all and fall again? The drawn card is '0 - The Fool (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The Fool upright is not naïve — it is willing. Falling isn’t failure when you fall into your own truth. What would it mean to begin again, even if you might break?"
