The mystical llama: "What is your concern?"  
The Traveler: "I’ve been withdrawing from people, but I’m not sure it’s helping. The drawn card is 'IX - The Hermit (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Hermit suggests isolation without insight — a retreat that numbs rather than heals. What part of you is hiding not for wisdom, but for protection?"

The Traveler: "I feel like I never reach completion. The drawn card is 'XXI - The World (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed World reveals an unfinished cycle or unmet closure. Something remains unsaid, or unlearned. What would bring true completion — not outside, but within?"

The Traveler: "I can’t seem to move on. The drawn card is 'XIII - Death (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Death shows resistance to transformation. You know change is necessary, yet you hesitate. What are you afraid will be lost if you let go?"

The Traveler: "This is my final question. Will I ever find peace with the choices I’ve made? The drawn card is 'XI - Justice (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "Justice reversed marks imbalance, bias, or avoidance of truth. Perhaps what you seek is not fairness from the world, but honesty with yourself. You are the court now — speak your verdict with courage, and peace will follow."
