The mystical llama: "What is your concern?"  
The Traveler: "Lately I’ve been retreating a lot — trying to understand what’s really going on inside. The drawn card is 'IX - The Hermit (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The Hermit upright seeks inner wisdom through solitude — but he doesn’t fear the dark. What have you learned from sitting with yourself?"

The Traveler: "Some parts of my life feel like they’ve ended, but I’m not grieving them — just... drifting. The drawn card is 'XIII - Death (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "Death upright invites transformation without mourning — some chapters close with quiet grace. What has ended to make space for a version of you still forming?"

The Traveler: "But I’m questioning the rules I once lived by. The drawn card is 'V - The Hierophant (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Hierophant questions tradition — not to rebel, but to realign. What truth is yours alone, even if it breaks from the path you were given?"

The Traveler: "This is my final question. Can I truly shape my own reality now? The drawn card is 'I - The Magician (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The upright Magician creates through presence and intention — your tools are already in hand. What will you build, now that you believe you can?"
