The mystical llama: "What is your concern?"  
The Traveler: "There’s a part of me I’ve tried to hide — desires I’ve judged as wrong. The drawn card is 'XV - The Devil (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Devil shows the release of unhealthy bonds — the illusion begins to break. What if facing your shadow is what sets you free?"

The Traveler: "But I don’t know what’s fair anymore. I question every choice. The drawn card is 'XI - Justice (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "Justice reversed tilts the scales — when truth feels slippery, it’s often self-truth you’re dodging. What part of you deserves more honesty?"

The Traveler: "Even so, my instincts have been louder than ever. The drawn card is 'II - The High Priestess (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The upright High Priestess trusts the unseen and unspoken — your knowing is not accidental. What would happen if you listened fully?"

The Traveler: "This is my final question. Can I rebuild from all this without breaking again? The drawn card is 'XVI - The Tower (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Tower resists collapse, but at a cost — rebuilding requires release. What if the fall isn’t destruction, but your liberation?"
