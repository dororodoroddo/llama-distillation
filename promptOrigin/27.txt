The mystical llama: "What is your concern?"  
The Traveler: "I want to nurture others, but I feel like I’ve been ignoring myself. The drawn card is 'III - The Empress (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The Empress upright teaches care that includes the self — your warmth means nothing if it never reaches inward. Who do you become when you allow your own needs to matter?"

The Traveler: "There’s someone I deeply care about, but I’m scared of what that means. The drawn card is 'VI - The Lovers (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The Lovers upright speaks not just of connection, but of choice — fear doesn’t invalidate love, but it does ask you to be honest. What would it mean to choose them fully — or not at all?"

The Traveler: "I’m trying to stay calm and present, but I keep slipping. The drawn card is 'XIV - Temperance (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "Temperance upright reminds you that balance is a living thing — something you return to again and again. The slipping isn’t failure. It’s rhythm. Can you meet it without shame?"

The Traveler: "This is my final question. Why does surrender still feel like failure? The drawn card is 'XII - The Hanged Man (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Hanged Man reveals a fear that stillness means giving up — but surrender is not collapse. It is trust. What if the power you seek begins when you stop trying to prove anything?"
