The mystical llama: "What is your concern?"  
The Traveler: "I want to believe again. The drawn card is 'XVII - The Star (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The Star upright is the soft light after a storm — a signal of renewal, healing, and quiet hope. You don’t have to force belief; you only have to stop silencing it. What would happen if you let your heart look up?"

The Traveler: "I feel like I missed something important. The drawn card is 'XX - Judgement (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Judgement reflects reluctance — not from failure, but from fear. You may be caught in a loop of self-questioning. What might open if you forgave yourself for not knowing everything all at once?"

The Traveler: "I want to be brave. The drawn card is 'VIII - Strength (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "Strength upright calls forth quiet courage — not boldness, but grace. You don’t need to roar to be powerful. What would it feel like to trust the gentleness within you?"

The Traveler: "This is my final question. How do I find wisdom in being alone? The drawn card is 'IX - The Hermit (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The Hermit upright blesses your solitude — a sacred time of reflection. Wisdom grows in silence. The world will wait; your light is kindled inside. Let yourself listen until it glows."
