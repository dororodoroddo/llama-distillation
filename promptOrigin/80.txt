The mystical llama: "What is your concern?"  
The Traveler: "I want to believe in fairness, but life feels unjust lately. The drawn card is 'XI - Justice (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "Justice upright calls for clarity, accountability, and self-honesty. What balance are you seeking — and what must you accept first?"

The Traveler: "I’ve been trying to stay strong, but I’m exhausted. The drawn card is 'VIII - Strength (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Strength reminds you: courage doesn’t always roar. What if softness — not endurance — is what you need now?"

The Traveler: "Even joy feels far away these days. The drawn card is 'XIX - The Sun (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Sun dims the light of clarity and warmth — not gone, just obscured. What has cast the shadow, and can you still feel the heat behind it?"

The Traveler: "This is my final question. Should I take a leap into something new? The drawn card is '0 - The Fool (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The upright Fool invites you to trust, not to be reckless but brave. What part of you is ready to begin before it’s fully ready?"
