The mystical llama: "What is your concern?"  
The Traveler: "I’ve surrendered to waiting, but I don’t know what for anymore. The drawn card is 'XII - The Hanged Man (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The Hanged Man upright shows transformation through stillness — but not all waiting is wisdom. What insight are you missing by holding back?"

The Traveler: "Sometimes I feel like I keep starting over and getting nowhere. The drawn card is '0 - The Fool (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Fool is hesitation disguised as caution — dreams left unchosen. What leap are you afraid will reveal your unworthiness?"

The Traveler: "Still, I want to believe the tides are finally turning. The drawn card is 'X - The Wheel of Fortune (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The upright Wheel brings change — sometimes sudden, sometimes quiet. What would it mean to welcome motion, even if it scares you?"

The Traveler: "This is my final question. Can I nurture something stable in this uncertainty? The drawn card is 'III - The Empress (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The Empress upright brings life through love, not certainty. What are you ready to tend, even if you don’t yet know how it will grow?"
