The mystical llama: "What is your concern?"  
The Traveler: "I feel like I’m drifting, disconnected. The drawn card is 'IX - The Hermit (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Hermit warns against losing yourself in separation. Solitude becomes a prison if you never leave. What could happen if you invited someone back in?"

The Traveler: "I’ve been chasing goals but never feel whole. The drawn card is 'XXI - The World (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed World reflects effort without resolution. It’s not about doing more — it’s about knowing what truly matters. What have you not yet acknowledged as ‘enough’?"

The Traveler: "I wonder if I’ve been avoiding my own intuition. The drawn card is 'II - The High Priestess (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed High Priestess speaks of inner silence or ignored instincts. Your knowing hasn’t gone — it’s been waiting patiently. What might it say if you finally listened?"

The Traveler: "This is my final question. What will remain after everything I’ve known falls away? The drawn card is 'XVI - The Tower (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The Tower upright brings revelation through disruption. This is the lightning bolt you needed — not punishment, but awakening. Let what must fall, fall. In the rubble, your new truth will rise, stronger than before."
