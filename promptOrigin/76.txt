The mystical llama: "What is your concern?"  
The Traveler: "I’ve been wrestling with a decision that feels morally complicated. The drawn card is 'XI - Justice (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "Justice upright weighs truth and consequence with clarity — fairness includes your own needs. What do you know is right, even if it’s hard?"

The Traveler: "But I fear I lack the ability to follow through. The drawn card is 'I - The Magician (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Magician forgets his own tools — not because they’re gone, but because doubt clouds vision. What would shift if you believed in your own hands?"

The Traveler: "There’s someone else involved, and I feel pulled toward them deeply. The drawn card is 'VI - The Lovers (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The Lovers upright is not just romance — it’s conscious, heart-centered alignment. What truth connects you, and are you willing to honor it?"

The Traveler: "This is my final question. Is all this change fated, or up to me? The drawn card is 'X - The Wheel of Fortune (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Wheel resists movement, but only when we cling. Fate dances with choice — what shift might come if you let go of control?"
