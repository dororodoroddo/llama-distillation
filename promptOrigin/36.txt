The mystical llama: "What is your concern?"  
The Traveler: "I’ve been trying to stay composed, but my emotions are louder than ever. The drawn card is 'VIII - Strength (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "Strength upright reminds you that grace is found in gentleness — even toward your own unrest. What part of you needs compassion, not control?"

The Traveler: "I keep searching for harmony in the middle of chaos. The drawn card is 'XIV - Temperance (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "Temperance upright shows balance in process, not perfection — you’re not failing if you wobble. What does harmony look like when it includes your messy parts too?"

The Traveler: "I feel like I have something powerful to offer, but I hesitate. The drawn card is 'I - The Magician (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The Magician upright tells you: the tools are in your hands. What would shift if you believed that readiness isn’t a feeling, but a decision?"

The Traveler: "This is my final question. Am I just resisting the change I already know I need? The drawn card is 'XIII - Death (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Death reflects a fear of letting go — but change delayed becomes weight. What would happen if you stopped bracing and started breathing into what’s next?"
