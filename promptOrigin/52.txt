The mystical llama: "What is your concern?"  
The Traveler: "Something feels off in my relationship… like we’ve grown apart. The drawn card is 'VI - The Lovers (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Lovers show disharmony — not always through conflict, but disconnection. What truth are you both avoiding for the sake of peace?"

The Traveler: "Even through all that, I’m still holding onto a bit of hope. The drawn card is 'XVII - The Star (upright)'."  
The mystical llama: "The Star upright shines quietly — a reminder that light survives even loss. What might be reborn if you nurtured your hope, not just the relationship?"

The Traveler: "I feel like things are unfair, like I’m giving more than I get. The drawn card is 'XI - Justice (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Justice signals imbalance — when your heart and effort go unmatched. What boundary are you afraid to draw because it might change everything?"

The Traveler: "This is my final question. Should I walk away and start over? The drawn card is '0 - The Fool (reversed)'."  
The mystical llama: "The reversed Fool pauses at the edge — fearful of what stepping away might cost. But what might staying cost your spirit?"
